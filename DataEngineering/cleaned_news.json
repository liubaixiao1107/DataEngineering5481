transparency and evidence-based formulation strategies in the cardiovascular supplement and nitric oxide booster category.understanding the nitric oxide problem: why blood flow and circulation decline with ageare you experiencing decreased energy levels, reduced exercise performance, or concerns about cardiovascular health and blood flow? the underlying issue may be declining nitric oxide production one of the most critical yet overlooked factors in healthy circulation, blood flow optimization, and cardiovascular function.the nobel prize-winning science behind nitric oxidenitric oxide (no) represents one of the most critical signaling molecules in human cardiovascular physiology a fact recognized by the 1998 nobel prize in physiology or medicine awarded to researchers louis j. ignarro, robert f. furchgott, and ferid murad who discovered nitric oxide's role as a cardiovascular signaling molecule.this gaseous molecule, produced naturally within vascular endothelial cells the specialized cells lining blood vessels throughout the body plays essential roles in multiple physiological processes including:blood vessel dilation- allowing arteries and veins to expand for improved blood flowcirculation optimization- supporting healthy blood flow to organs and tissuesoxygen delivery- enhancing oxygen transport to working muscles and vital organsvascular health maintenance- protecting endothelial function throughout the cardiovascular systemblood pressure regulation- supporting healthy blood pressure levels already in normal rangesince the nobel prize recognition, over 60,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers have been published examining various aspects of nitric oxide biology, cardiovascular function, vascular health, and potential interventions to support healthy no levels throughout the lifespan.the age-related nitric oxide decline: a growing health concernresearch published incirculation research(2003) by taddei and colleagues documented that endogenous nitric oxide production tends to decline progressively with advancing age, beginning as early as the third decade of life and accelerating in later decades. this age-related reduction in no bioavailability has been associated with changes in vascular function that occur as part of normal aging processes, including increased arterial stiffness, reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and altered blood flow distribution patterns.a comprehensive study published inthe american journal of physiology(2009) found thatnitric oxide production decreased by approximately 50% between ages 20 and 60in apparently healthy adults with no diagnosed cardiovascular disease, highlighting the substantial magnitude of age-related no decline even in the absence of disease states.this decline occurs through multiple mechanisms including:reduced expression of nitric oxide synthase enzymesdecreased availability of cofactors necessary for nos enzyme functionincreased oxidative stress that degrades nitric oxide moleculesstructural changes in blood vessel walls affecting circulationlifestyle factors that destroy your nitric oxide productionenvironmental factors, lifestyle patterns, and dietary choices also substantially influence nitric oxide levels independent of chronological age.research published innitric oxide(2008) demonstrated that these factors can significantly impact the body's ability to produce and maintain adequate nitric oxide concentrations for optimal blood flow and circulation:physical inactivity- sedentary lifestyle reducing vascular functionpoor dietary patterns- diets low in nitrate-containing vegetables like leafy greens and beetschronic oxidative stress- from various environmental and metabolic sourcescigarette smoking- directly damaging vascular endothelial cellsexcessive alcohol consumption- impairing nitric oxide production pathwayschronic stress- elevating cortisol and damaging cardiovascular healthmetabolic conditions- including insulin resistance and metabolic syndromethe nitric boost ultra solution:the formulation was specifically developed to address multiple control points in nitric oxide biology, providing substrates for no production through both major biological pathways, supporting the enzymatic systems responsible for generating nitric oxide, and supplying protective antioxidant compounds that help preserve nitric oxide molecules from oxidative degradation once produced.read:how nitric boost ultra aligns with rising search interest in nitric oxide support, non-stimulant circulation supplements, and transparency-driven men s health products.the nitric boost ultra dual-pathway strategy: comprehensive nitric oxide support for maximum blood flowhuman physiology employs two primary pathways for generating nitric oxide, each with distinct characteristics, regulation, and physiological importance. the nitric boost formulation strategically targetsboth mechanisms simultaneouslybased on current scientific understanding of nitric oxide biology and vascular physiology providing superior cardiovascular support and blood flow optimization compared to single-pathway formulas:pathway #1: the l-arginine-nos pathway (classical pathway)this well-established pathway, characterized extensively since the 1980s and 1990s, involves the amino acid l-arginine serving as the primary substrate for a family of nitric oxide synthase (nos) enzymes. three distinct nos isoforms exist in human tissues: endothelial nos (enos) expressed in vascular endothelial cells, neuronal nos (nnos) in nervous system tissues, and inducible nos (inos) in immune cells.research published inpharmacological reviews(1991) provided comprehensive characterization of this pathway and its central role in cardiovascular regulation, blood flow optimization, and healthy circulation support, describing the complex enzymatic mechanisms, cofactor requirements, and regulatory systems controlling nos enzyme activity.pathway #2: the nitrate-nitrite-no pathway (alternative pathway)this complementary pathway, characterized in molecular detail through research published infree radical biology & medicine(2003) and extensively examined innitric oxide(2008), involves dietary nitrates (no3-) converting to nitrite (no2-) through bacterial reduction by enzymes in oral bacteria, then further converting to nitric oxide through various mechanisms.this pathway demonstrates several unique characteristics that complement the classical l-arginine-nos pathway for enhanced blood flow support:oxygen-independent function- generates nitric oxide even under low-oxygen conditionsacidic environment activation- particularly active in metabolic conditionsbackup mechanism- maintains nitric oxide signaling when nos pathway is compromisedendothelial dysfunction support- functions when classical pathway is impairedwhy dual-pathway nitric oxide support delivers superior resultsa landmark study published inhypertension(2010) by researchers at the karolinska institute demonstrated that these pathways operate complementarily rather than competitively, with the nitrate-nitrite pathway becoming particularly important under conditions where the nos pathway may be compromised by endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, cofactor depletion, or other challenges to classical no production.most importantly for blood flow optimization, research published incirculation(2012) examined the interaction and synergy between these pathways in human subjects, finding thatsimultaneous support of both the l-arginine-nos pathway and the nitrate-nitrite pathway produced greater improvements in vascular function markers including flow-mediated dilation and blood pressure than targeting either pathway alone providing direct scientific support for the multi-pathway formulation strategy employed in nitric boost ultra.clinical research foundation: beet root powder for blood flow and circulation enhancementbeet root powder serves as the cornerstone dietary nitrate source in nitric boost ultra, selected based on exceptionally extensive clinical research documenting beetroot's cardiovascular effects, blood pressure support, circulation enhancement, blood flow optimization, and exercise performance benefits across diverse populations, age ranges, health statuses, and study designs.landmark blood pressure and vascular function researchthe scientific foundation for beetroot supplementation in cardiovascular applications began with a groundbreaking study published inhypertension(2008) by webb and colleagues at barts and the london school of medicine. this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of beetroot juice consumption on blood pressure and vascular function in healthy volunteers.the study found that consumption of 500 ml of beetroot juice containing approximately 1,400 mg of nitrate led toclinically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure of 10.4 mm hg and diastolic blood pressure of 8.0 mm hgcompared to nitrate-depleted placebo beetroot juice. the magnitude of blood pressure reduction was comparable to some pharmaceutical blood pressure medications, highlighting the substantial physiological impact of dietary nitrate provision for cardiovascular health support.notably, blood flow and circulation effects were observable within 3 hours of consumption, peaked at approximately 2.5-3 hours post-consumption corresponding with peak plasma nitrite levels, and remained measurable for up to 24 hours after a single dose demonstrating sustained nitric oxide support throughout the day.disclaimer:this research examines beetroot's effects on blood pressure in controlled clinical settings with careful measurement of cardiovascular parameters. these findings represent research outcomes in study populations and do not constitute medical claims about disease treatment or prevention. individual responses vary based on baseline health status and other factors.a dose-response study published inhypertension(2013) by kapil and colleagues investigated the minimum effective dose of dietary nitrate from beetroot required to produce measurable cardiovascular effects for blood flow support. the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial systematically tested various nitrate doses in individuals with hypertension, finding that even relatively modest amounts of dietary nitrate (approximately 6.4 mmol, equivalent to about 400 mg of nitrate) could produce measurable beneficial effects on blood pressure support and circulation enhancement.a comprehensive meta-analysis published inthe journal of nutrition(2013) by siervo and colleagues reviewed 16 randomized controlled clinical trials examining beetroot juice and dietary nitrate supplementation effects on blood pressure and vascular function across 254 participants with varying baseline blood pressure status. the systematic analysis found thatbeetroot juice supplementation significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 4.4 mm hg on averageacross all studies for enhanced cardiovascular support.effects were more pronounced in individuals with elevated baseline blood pressure (greater reductions in hypertensive versus normotensive individuals), in studies using higher nitrate doses for optimal nitric oxide support (doses above 300 mg showed greater effects), and in longer-duration studies (chronic supplementation over 2+ weeks showed greater blood flow and circulation benefits than acute single-dose studies).view data on beet root, l-citrulline, and l-arginine trialsexercise performance, muscle oxygenation, and blood flow efficiency researchbeyond blood pressure support, extensive research has examined beetroot supplementation for exercise performance, oxygen utilization efficiency, blood flow distribution during physical activity, and circulation optimization applications directly relevant to cardiovascular function and nitric oxide enhancement.a pioneering study published in thejournal of applied physiology(2009) by bailey and colleagues at the university of exeter examined beetroot juice supplementation effects on exercise efficiency and endurance in healthy adults. the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial found that dietary nitrate supplementation from beetroot juice (approximately 500 mg nitrate daily for 6 days)reduced the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise by 5.4%andimproved time to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise by 16%compared to the nitrate-depleted placebo condition.researchers hypothesized that enhanced nitric oxide availability from dietary nitrates improved:mitochondrial efficiency- reducing oxygen cost of atp productionblood flow distribution- enhancing microvascular perfusion to working musclesmuscle contractile efficiency- improving performance during physical activityoxygen delivery- optimizing oxygen transport to active tissuesresearch published in thebritish journal of nutrition(2012) by vanhatalo and colleagues investigated beetroot supplementation effects on muscle tissue oxygenation during exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy technology. the study found that beetroot juice consumptionimproved muscle tissue oxygenation patterns during high-intensity exercise, with better maintenance of muscle oxygen levels during intense work and faster reoxygenation during recovery periods suggesting enhanced microvascular blood flow and improved oxygen delivery efficiency for superior circulation support.a study published inmedicine & science in sports & exercise(2011) by lansley and colleagues examined beetroot juice supplementation in trained cyclists performing simulated competitive time trials. the randomized, double-blind, crossover study found that beetroot supplementationimproved cycling time trial performance by 2.8%compared to placebo a substantial performance enhancement in trained athletes where improvements of 1-2% can determine competitive outcomes.vascular function and endothelial health for enhanced circulationresearch has also examined beetroot's effects on vascular function through direct measurement of endothelial-dependent vasodilation considered the gold-standard assessment of vascular health, blood flow optimization, and nitric oxide bioavailability in clinical research.a study published infree radical biology & medicine(2012) investigated beetroot juice effects on endothelial function measured by flow-mediated dilation (fmd) of the brachial artery, a non-invasive ultrasound technique that assesses nitric oxide-dependent vascular function. the randomized, controlled trial found that acute beetroot juice consumption (approximately 500 mg nitrate)improved fmd by 20%in healthy adults measured 2-3 hours post-consumption, indicating enhanced endothelial nitric oxide production and improved blood flow capacity.research published innutrition journal(2012) examined chronic beetroot supplementation effects over 2 weeks in healthy adults, finding sustained improvements in endothelial function measured by fmd and significant reductions in markers of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde and oxidized ldl cholesterol for enhanced cardiovascular health support.l-citrulline dl-malate: superior bioavailability for enhanced arginine levels and nitric oxide productionl-citrulline represents a strategically important ingredient choice in nitric boost ultra based on its unique pharmacokinetic properties that make it substantially more effective than direct l-arginine supplementation for raising plasma arginine levels and supporting nitric oxide production a counterintuitive finding that has been confirmed across multiple independent research studies for optimal blood flow support.comparative bioavailability research: citrulline versus arginine for nitric oxidea pivotal pharmacokinetic study published in thebritish journal of nutrition(2011) by schwedhelm and colleagues directly compared oral l-citrulline versus l-arginine supplementation effects on plasma amino acid concentrations in healthy adults. the randomized, double-blind crossover study administered equivalent doses (3 grams) of either l-citrulline or l-arginine and measured plasma concentrations over 8 hours.the counterintuitive finding confirmed through careful pharmacokinetic measurements was thatl-citrulline supplementation produced approximately 2-fold greater increases in plasma l-arginine concentrations compared to direct l-arginine supplementation at the same dosefor superior nitric oxide support. peak plasma arginine levels were higher and the elevation was more sustained with citrulline supplementation, remaining elevated for longer durations (6-8 hours) than after direct arginine intake (3-4 hours).this remarkable bioavailability advantage for blood flow optimization relates to first-pass metabolism physiology. when l-arginine is consumed orally, significant amounts (approximately 40-60%) are metabolized by arginase enzymes highly expressed in intestinal and liver tissues before the amino acid reaches systemic circulation available for uptake by vascular endothelial cells where nitric oxide is produced.l-citrulline, in contrast, is not a substrate for arginase enzymes and is absorbed efficiently from the intestine without significant intestinal metabolism. it passes through the liver with minimal first-pass extraction. once in systemic circulation, l-citrulline is taken up primarily by the kidneys where it undergoes conversion to l-arginine effectively bypassing the metabolic barriers in the gut and liver that limit l-arginine bioavailability for enhanced circulation support.research published in thejournal of nutrition(2007) by bode-b ger and colleagues confirmed this bioavailability advantage using sophisticated stable isotope tracer methodology. the study demonstrated thatl-citrulline supplementation increased whole-body nitric oxide synthesis more effectively than l-arginine supplementation at equivalent doses, as measured by isotope-labeled arginine flux and citrulline-arginine conversion tracking for optimal cardiovascular function.clinical trials on cardiovascular function and vascular healthmultiple randomized controlled clinical trials have directly examined l-citrulline supplementation effects on cardiovascular parameters, vascular function, blood pressure support, and circulation optimization across diverse populations.a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial published in theamerican journal of hypertension(2012) by figueroa and colleagues investigated l-citrulline supplementation in middle-aged adults with prehypertension (blood pressure 120-139/80-89 mm hg). participants received either 6 grams of l-citrulline or matching placebo daily for 6 weeks.the study found that l-citrulline supplementation significantly improved multiple cardiovascular parameters for enhanced blood flow:arterial stiffness- decreased pulse wave velocity indicating improved arterial complianceaortic blood pressure- reduced central pressure closest to the heartendothelial function- improved brachial artery flow-mediated dilation by approximately 2-3 percentage pointsvascular health- enhanced nitric oxide bioavailability throughout the cardiovascular systemresearch published invascular medicine(2016) by ochiai and colleagues examined l-citrulline supplementation effects specifically in postmenopausal women a population at substantially increased cardiovascular risk. the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial administered either 6 grams of l-citrulline or placebo daily for 6 weeks. the study found that citrulline supplementationsignificantly improved pulse wave velocity and augmentation index both key measures of arterial compliance, blood flow optimization, and cardiovascular health.meta-analytic evidence supporting l-citrulline for blood pressure and circulationa systematic review and meta-analysis published inmaturitas(2016) by figueroa and colleagues examined all available controlled trials investigating l-citrulline and l-arginine supplementation effects on blood pressure as the primary outcome for cardiovascular support. the analysis included 8 trials meeting inclusion criteria with 196 total participants across studies.the meta-analysis found that citrulline supplementationsignificantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 4.1 mm hg and diastolic blood pressure by 2.1 mm hg on averageacross all included studies for enhanced circulation support.effects were more pronounced in several subgroup analyses:individuals with elevated baseline blood pressure showed greater reductions for optimal cardiovascular healthstudies using citrulline doses of 6 grams or higher daily showed greater blood flow effectslonger intervention periods (4+ weeks) showed more consistent nitric oxide production benefitsa comprehensive narrative review published innutrients(2017) by cutrufello and colleagues examined the totality of evidence supporting l-citrulline supplementation for cardiovascular health across multiple outcome domains.the review concluded that substantial evidence supports citrulline's ability to:increase plasma argininemore effectively than arginine supplementation itselfenhance nitric oxide productionmeasured by plasma nitrite and other biomarkersimprove endothelial functionassessed by flow-mediated dilation for blood flow optimizationsupport healthy blood pressureparticularly in individuals with elevated baseline valuesimprove exercise capacitythrough enhanced blood flow and oxygen deliverycitrulline malate combination for enhanced performancenitric boost ultra utilizes l-citrulline dl-malate rather than l-citrulline alone, combining the amino acid citrulline with malic acid (malate). malate represents an important intermediate compound in the citric acid cycle, the primary cellular energy production pathway.research published in thejournal of strength and conditioning research(2010) by p rez-guisado and jakeman investigated citrulline malate supplementation effects on exercise performance and recovery. the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that 8 grams of citrulline malate supplementation taken one hour before resistance exercisesignificantly improved total repetitions to failure during bench press exercise (52.92% increase across multiple sets) and reduced muscle soreness ratings at 24 and 48 hours post-exercisecompared to placebo for enhanced physical performance.disclaimer:research on l-citrulline examines its effects on cardiovascular markers and vascular function in various study populations. individual responses vary based on baseline health status, age, genetic factors, and other variables. this research represents scientific investigation of physiological effects and does not constitute medical claims about disease treatment or prevention. supplements are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.also read:dive deeper into the viral salt trick for men and the science-backed formula behind nitric boost ultra s circulation support benefitsl-arginine: direct substrate for immediate nitric oxide productiondespite l-citrulline's superior bioavailability for raising plasma arginine levels over time, nitric boost ultra includes l-arginine as a complementary ingredient to provide immediate substrate availability for enzymatic nitric oxide production through the classical l-arginine-nos pathway, allowing the formulation to support both rapid and sustained nitric oxide generation for optimal blood flow and circulation enhancement.foundational research establishing l-arginine's vascular effectsl-arginine has been studied extensively in cardiovascular research for over three decades since its identification as the sole substrate for nitric oxide synthase enzymes. pioneering research published incirculation(1990) by creager and colleagues at brigham and women's hospital demonstrated that l-arginine improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation (nitric oxide-mediated blood vessel relaxation) in individuals with hypercholesterolemia, establishing proof of concept that arginine availability could influence nitric oxide-mediated vascular function for blood flow support.clinical trials examining oral arginine supplementation for cardiovascular healtha meta-analysis published inthe american heart journal(2006) by bai and colleagues systematically reviewed all available randomized controlled trials examining oral l-arginine supplementation effects on endothelial function measured by flow-mediated dilation. the analysis included 13 trials with 492 total participants.the meta-analysis found thatl-arginine supplementation significantly improved flow-mediated dilation by 1.62 percentage points on averagecompared to placebo a modest but clinically meaningful improvement in this gold-standard measure of endothelial nitric oxide-mediated vascular function and blood flow capacity.subgroup analyses revealed important patterns for optimal cardiovascular support:effects most pronounced in studies using doses above 3 grams daily for nitric oxide productionbenefits greater in populations with existing vascular dysfunction or cardiovascular risk factorslonger supplementation periods (2+ weeks) showed more consistent blood flow benefitsresearch published inatherosclerosis(2000) by maxwell and colleagues examined l-arginine supplementation in individuals with peripheral arterial disease (pad) a condition where narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the legs. the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial administered 6 grams of l-arginine twice daily (12 grams total daily) for 3 weeks. the study found that arginine supplementationsignificantly improved pain-free walking distance by 66% and maximum walking distance by 77%compared to placebo substantial functional improvements suggesting enhanced blood flow and circulation to working leg muscles.safety profile and important considerationsresearch published inthe journal of nutrition(2002) reviewed safety data from numerous clinical trials using l-arginine doses ranging from 3 to 30 grams daily, finding that supplementation was generally well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects. the most common side effects were mild gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly at higher doses.however, research has also identified certain populations that should avoid high-dose l-arginine supplementation. a study published injama(2006) examining l-arginine supplementation following recent myocardial infarction (heart attack) found potential adverse effects in this specific high-risk population, emphasizing the critical importance of medical consultation before supplementation.disclaimer:while substantial research supports l-arginine's effects on vascular function and its general safety profile at recommended doses in healthy populations, individual responses vary significantly. certain medical conditions, particularly recent cardiac events, may contraindicate supplementation. healthcare provider consultation is essential before beginning l-arginine supplementation, especially for individuals with diagnosed cardiovascular disease, recent heart attack or stroke, or unstable cardiac conditions.ginkgo biloba: extensive research on circulation support and antioxidant protectionginkgo biloba extract represents one of the most extensively researched botanical supplements globally for blood flow optimization, with particular scientific attention focused on its effects on circulation, vascular function, and neuroprotection. over 400 clinical trials have examined ginkgo biloba across various health applications, providing substantial evidence for its biological activities supporting cardiovascular health and nitric oxide preservation.clinical research on peripheral circulation and blood flow enhancementa comprehensive meta-analysis published inhuman psychopharmacology(2007) by weinmann and colleagues reviewed all available controlled trials examining ginkgo effects on cerebral blood flow blood flow to the brain using various sophisticated measurement methodologies. the analysis included 13 studies and found thatginkgo supplementation produced measurable and statistically significant improvements in cerebral circulationacross multiple measurement techniques, with effects attributed to vasodilatory properties improving blood vessel diameter and blood viscosity-reducing effects for enhanced microvascular blood flow.research published in thejournal of cardiovascular pharmacology(1998) by durand and colleagues investigated ginkgo extract effects on endothelium-dependent vasodilation using flow-mediated dilation measurements of the brachial artery. the randomized, placebo-controlled study found that 4 weeks of ginkgo supplementation (120 mg twice daily of standardized extract, total 240 mg daily)enhanced flow-mediated vasodilation by approximately 12%compared to placebo, suggesting improved endothelial nitric oxide production and enhanced blood flow capacity throughout the vascular system.a comprehensive meta-analysis published inatherosclerosis(2004) by pittler and ernst systematically examined all available clinical trials investigating ginkgo biloba supplementation effects in individuals with peripheral arterial disease (pad), specifically intermittent claudication. the analysis included 9 placebo-controlled trials with 465 total participants. the meta-analysis found thatginkgo supplementation significantly improved pain-free walking distance by 34 meters on average approximately a 40% increase suggesting meaningfully enhanced blood flow and circulation to leg muscles during exercise.compare clinical evidence across nitric oxide pathwaysantioxidant properties for nitric oxide protection and preservationone critical challenge in maintaining adequate nitric oxide bioavailability for optimal blood flow involves protecting no molecules from oxidative degradation once produced. nitric oxide readily reacts with superoxide radicals to form peroxynitrite, eliminating no's beneficial vasodilatory effects.research published infree radical biology & medicine(2003) by kobuchi and colleagues examined ginkgo extract's antioxidant properties, finding that flavonoid components effectively scavenged various reactive oxygen species including:superoxide radicals- preventing them from reacting with nitric oxide for enhanced blood flowhydroxyl radicals- among the most reactive and damaging free radicalsperoxyl radicals- involved in lipid peroxidation cascades damaging cell membranesthis broad-spectrum antioxidant activity suggests that ginkgo may help preserve nitric oxide bioavailability by reducing the oxidative stress burden that would otherwise degrade no molecules before they can exert beneficial vascular effects for circulation optimization.a study published innitric oxide(2006) by chen and colleagues specifically investigated ginkgo effects on nitric oxide-related pathways in cultured vascular endothelial cells. the research found that ginkgo extractenhanced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) expression and enzymatic activity, suggesting a direct mechanism supporting increased nitric oxide production capacity. additionally, ginkgo reduced markers of oxidative stress, providing both increased no generation and protection from oxidative degradation for superior blood flow support.disclaimer:while extensive research supports ginkgo biloba's effects on circulation and vascular function across various study populations, individual responses vary. ginkgo may interact with anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications due to its documented effects on platelet function. individuals taking blood-thinning medications or with bleeding disorders should consult healthcare providers before supplementation. ginkgo should be discontinued at least 2-4 weeks before any surgical procedures due to potential increased bleeding risk.supporting botanicals and amino acids for enhanced cardiovascular functionhorny goat weed (epimedium):this traditional botanical contains icariin as its primary bioactive compound. research published inthe journal of sexual medicine(2008) found icariin enhanced nitric oxide production through multiple mechanisms including increased enos expression for blood flow support. a study inlife sciences(2004) found icariin demonstrated mild pde5 inhibitory properties. research inbmc complementary and alternative medicine(2014) found epimedium extract improved endothelial function in animal models.disclaimer:human clinical data is more limited

(angelica sinensis):traditional botanical with centuries of documented use in traditional medicine systems. research inlife sciences(2003) found extract components promoted vascular smooth muscle relaxation. a study inphytotherapy research(2002) found ferulic acid enhanced nitric oxide production in endothelial cells. research injournal of cardiovascular pharmacology(2007) found improvements in microvascular blood flow in animal models.disclaimer:clinical evidence from human trials is less extensive than other formula ingredients. may interact with anticoagulant medications. healthcare consultation recommended.d-aspartic acid:amino acid studied for endocrine regulation and hormone production. research inreproductive biology and endocrinology(2009) found d-aa supplementation (3.12 grams daily for 12 days) increased luteinizing hormone by 33% and testosterone by 42% in men. research innutrition research(2015) found significant testosterone increases over 28 days. however, a study injournal of the international society of sports nutrition(2015) found no effects in men with already-optimal baseline levels, suggesting benefits primarily in those with suboptimal status.disclaimer:effects vary based on baseline hormone status. not intended for hormone disorders or medical conditions. consult providers, especially those with hormone-sensitive conditions or prostate concerns.niacin (vitamin b3): decades of cardiovascular researchniacin has extensive cardiovascular research spanning over six decades with well-established mechanisms supporting vascular health and blood flow optimization.research incirculation(2004) found niacin significantly improved flow-mediated dilation in individuals with low hdl cholesterol. a comprehensive review injournal of clinical lipidology(2012) noted consistent beneficial effects on hdl cholesterol (typically increasing 15-35%), triglycerides (typically decreasing 20-50%), and ldl cholesterol (typically decreasing 5-25%) at doses of 1-3 grams daily for enhanced cardiovascular health.disclaimer: niacin causes harmless flushing in 60-80% of users temporary warmth, redness, and tingling lasting 30-90 minutes that decreases substantially with continued use. consult providers regarding diabetes medications, blood pressure medications, liver conditions, or peptic ulcers.independent consumer satisfaction research:

reforms and fixates on short-term, populist policies.jang deok-jin (professor, seoul national university) warned,  populism is a phenomenon that uses democracy to harm democracy.  populism turns politics into a dangerous spectacle for venting anger, rather than a forum for designing a national vision for the next century. jang also noted,  the argument that party politics must be restored and parliamentary elements strengthened especially when the ruling party is recklessly outpacing the president has lost persuasive power. the democratic party s pattern of failure.the standard of failure is whether they can extend their hold on power. while not comparable to the twice-impeached people power party, kim soon-deok (columnist, dong-a ilbo) identifies three causes of the democratic party s failures.first, the besieged fortress syndrome: even in power, a victim mentality of being under attack leads to uncompromising rigidity.second, the arrogance of progressivism: the belief that  we are right  narrows even the president s room to maneuver.third, intellectual stagnation: politics driven by a  nation-saving steel-formation  mentality leaves no space for dialogue or compromise.when the

political bias. rushing to finalize the ruling on lee jae-myung s supreme court appeal a month before the election can only be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to influence the presidential race.han in-seop (seoul national university professor) assessed,  cho hee-dae has transcended being a political judge he has become a  politician in judicial robes.   the chief justice should not be a  monarch  isolated in a judicial fortress, but must actively communicate with the sovereign people. (omitted) the more the judiciary tries to sanctify itself, the farther it drifts from the public. the current judicial crisis does not come from outside. it stems from internal arrogance and insularity that fail to persuade the people. to restore eroded judicial trust, cho hee-dae must make a decisive choice about his own position. related link.who checks the checkers, and how?im jae-sung (haemaru law firm) assessed,  the democratic party s judicial reform agenda is woefully inadequate. there are roughly five points: first, increasing the number of supreme court justices; second, improving the nomination process for justices; third, reforming the judge evaluation system; fourth, expanding the scope of lower court ruling disclosures; and fifth, introducing preliminary hearings for search and seizure warrants. the only novel proposal is increasing the number of justices.im jae-sung asks,  does increasing the number of supreme court justices enable the checkers to be checked?  politics must propose, persuade, and finalize policies for a judiciary that having grown from  tools of power  into an  unchecked power  does not sway with the chief justice s ambitions, where judges do not fixate on promotions but rule by law and conscience, and where the institution earns public trust. i ask the democratic party: what is the ruling party s judicial reform beyond expanding the supreme court bench? related link.related link."

    "text": "save this storysave this storysave this storysave this storyfor months,donald trumphas presented himself as the very incarnation of a global peacemaker, touting an ever-changing list of international conflicts that he claims to have settled. sometimes it has been six, sometimes as many as ten.  i ended seven wars,  the president told the u.n. general assembly last month,  and in all cases they were raging, with countless thousands of people being killed,  which was not true but has not stopped trump from repeating it. two alleged conflicts on the white house s list egypt versus ethiopia and serbia versus kosovo were not current wars by any definition. it is true, though, that trump has leveraged the power of his personal diplomacy to broker a number of ceasefire agreements, but lasting peace deals have proved elusive. in africa, for example, the three-decade-long conflict between militia groups in rwanda and the democratic republic of the congo continues largely unabated, notwithstanding an agreement brokered by the u.s. in june that trump hailed as  a great day for the world!  nor have trump s accomplishments as a mediator always been accepted as such by the warring parties themselves. when the president boasted repeatedly that he had got india and pakistan to resolve the latest outbreak of fighting over kashmir, india s leader,narendra modi, was so angry at what he saw as trump s misrepresentations that their falling out now threatens america s years-long effort to cultivate india as a key strategic partner in the u.s. rivalry with china.but the main point, as trump sees it, is that he s done a lot to make peace, so much so, it seems, that it s hard for him to keep track of all the countries whose troubles he s solving. in september, he boasted of his peace efforts in a nonexistent territorial war between armenia and cambodia, two countries some four thousand miles apart from each other, and he twice said albania rather than armenia when he bragged about ending its long-running conflict with azerbaijan. (trump s gaffes led to much hilarity among fellow-leaders on the sidelines of a recent summit in copenhagen, where the prime minister of albania, edi rama, wascaught on tapechiding the french president,emmanuel macron.  you should make an apology,  he said,  because you didn t congratulate us on the peace deal that president trump made between albania and azerbaijan.  azerbaijan s leader, ilham aliyev, who was standing nearby, burst out laughing.)even with all that, trump could not claim to have made any breakthroughs in the two major wars that he had made it a priority of his presidency to end the israel-hamas conflict in gaza and the russian invasion of ukraine. until now, that is. late on wednesday evening, in a social-media post, trump finally had something to truly trumpet:  i am very proud to announce that israel and hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,  he wrote just after 7p.m. blessed are the peacemakers! the ceasefire deal, brokered with the help of america s arab allies, such as qatar and egypt, calls for israel to stop fighting within twenty-four hours and to partially withdraw from gaza, and for hamas to release by early next week all twenty israeli hostages presumed to still be alive two years after they were taken during hamas soctober 7th terrorist attack. at a cabinet meeting on thursday, as advisers made plans for trump to fly to the region on sunday night for a signing ceremony, the president touted his  momentous breakthrough. the prospect of peace in gaza led even trump s critics to praise the deal,  the first hopeful moment in a long time,  as chris van hollen, a maryland democrat who has been outspoken in pressuring trump (and joe biden before him) to do more to end the conflict, put it. trump s supporters, meanwhile, were as jubilant as if he d gottenbenjamin netanyahuand muhammad ismail darwish to embrace on the temple mount (something the israeli prime minister and the head of hamas s leadership council most certainly will not do).in many ways, it was trump s willingness to pressure netanyahu that really forced the deal. the israeli prime minister had  no option but to cave,  as daniel kurtzer, a former u.s. ambassador to israel, told me last week after hamas agreed in principle to peace talks on trump s terms.aaron david miller, a veteran u.s. mideast negotiator for presidents of both parties, also predicted more or less what ended up happening, with the main uncertainty being not the phase-one ceasefire but whether a more lasting postwar arrangement for gaza and crucial details such as hamas s disarmament can be agreed upon.  trump wants a deal. he ll settle for all hostages out and an end to the comprehensive israeli military campaign,  miller told me after last week s hamas news.  bibi can t afford to alienate him. on the contrary, he needs trump to win israeli elections in 2026. as if to reinforce the point, netanyahu not only signed off on the ceasefire deal but then released an a.i.-generated image on social media of himself with trump, as the u.s. president received the nobel peace prize a faked scene that spoke to trump s oft-stated aspiration to claim the award.  he deserves it!  netanyahu wrote. this year s winner of the prize, in fact, is due to be announced on friday morning, and while hardly anyone expects trump to claim it, many republicans saw the gaza news as a chance to demand it for him anyway.  those groups of academics and  lites that are sitting in norway, that board of people that decides it, they need to give president trump the nobel peace prize,  brian mast, a florida republican, said on fox news. ( thank you brian!!!,  the president responded on his truth social platform.)prize or no prize, trump seized on the moment to declare that, because of him, the war was over.  we settled seven wars or major conflicts but wars and this is no. 8,  trump said at a cabinet meeting on thursday.  this is peace in the middle east.  there were no caveats or quibbles about what a phase two might look like.it was hard to square all the encomiums for trump rolling in from republicans, hailing him as, basically, the greatest peacemaker in the history of the world, with the martial rhetoric that had actually been emanating from the president this week. talk about cognitive dissonance. even as trump was negotiating an end to hostilities in the middle east, he was at the same time ordering hundreds of national guard troops to what he insisted were  war-ravaged  american cities, such as portland and chicago, and all but provoking open conflict with the democratic elected officials who run those places.trump has not only likened portland to a war zone but called it  under siege  and in a state of  insurrection  against the federal government. he s used similar language about chicago.  it s like a war zone,  he said of crime in the city.  it s probably worse than almost any city in the world.  if the courts block him from deploying the troops he s already called up, he s said he s considering using the insurrection act to call out more of them. he seemed both infuriated and undeterred after a federal judge, whom trump himself appointed, warned that america should be governed by  constitutional law, not martial law. there are many remarkable aspects to trump s decision to escalate his fight against large swaths of america, not least of which is that it is all based on the lie that there is anything approaching war-like levels of civil unrest in the cities he s targeted.  there is no rebellion in illinois,  the state s lawyers argued in court on thursday. oregon s democratic governor, tina kotek, similarly declared,  there is no insurrection in portland, no threat to national security.  does it even matter? the federal judge in oregon found that trump s rationale for the deployment was  untethered to facts,  but reports on thursday from the federal appeals court that will decide whether the lower court s ruling stands suggested the judges there were inclined to overturn it and let trump have his war anyway.and that, in the end, is the most amazing thing of all. the threats that haunt trump, and against which he rallies our troops, as in that chilling seventy-two-minute speech he made to america s entire military leadership in quantico just a week ago, come not from foreign powers but from  dangerous  domestic battlegrounds that ought to be used as  training grounds  for the u.s. military. trump has labelled himself a  president of peace,  as he searches for international accolades. but at home in america it is the battle with what he calls  the enemy from within  that has consumed him and come to define his presidency."

if i owned the global stock market   with around 70% in us equities, heavily weighted towards tech stocks   i d be feeling really jittery. i ve already skewed my equity holdings somewhat away from us equities.people are making the obvious comparison with the dotcom boom, which was succeeded by a decade of sluggish returns in us stocks. but not many people   including, i expect, not many of your readers   were heavily invested at the time.obviouslymonevatordoesn t provide advice, but i expect it can provide some helpful ways to think about this!i ve had a dozen emails or comments like this in the past month. often they ll add they knowmonevatordoesn t write about such matters   market timing, boo hiss   but could we make an exception?this is puzzling to me because we do write about such stuff. quite often!indeed i sometimes fret that we write about it too much, and so potentially put would-be passive investors on a path tomeme stockpunting.today then i ll answer our (splendid) reader s question by pointing you towards a few of those answers we ve given earlier.firstly, what exactly are we worried about?discussion about frothy market levels may conflate at least four things:the market being very high, or up a lot over a short period, or it being expensive, or it being overvalued on some metricsuch as p/e, or all of the abovei m not being pedantic. these statements imply different things. taking action with a passive portfolio on account of any of them will probably do more harm than good for most people, most of the time   that s whatthe datasays anyway   so you should know what is bothering you before you try to fix it.for instance, a market may appear expensive on the basis of p/e multiples. but if we ve been in a recession that s ending and earnings are set to bounce back,a high p/ewill rapidly come down.or: markets can go up very quickly and keep going up for many years more. they can rise especially fast out of bear markets   when, ironically, investors may be too shellshocked to trust those gains.also a stock market isn t expensive just because it is  high . during a 40-year investing career you d hope to see the major indices hit many all-time highs.the s&p 500 index was well under 1,000 in the mid-1990s. now it s pushing 7,000:source:yahoothe s&p has returned more than 800% over the past three decades, and that s before dividends. selling just because it s  up a lot  is silly.and yet many investors   even old-timers   seem to see equity markets as like sine waves, to be surfed on the ascent and pulled out of before they tumble.yes, day-to-day   even year-to-year   stock markets can be as choppy as any semi-rideable british seaside wave.but long-term investing in shares is much more like mountain climbing than surfing.the us market is expensivearguably the most credibleguideto a market being genuinely expensive in light of all this is the cape aka shiller aka p/e ratio. all names for basically the same thing   a metric that reflects the price you re paying for company earnings averaged over a longer time period.such a ratio aims to smooth out the peaks and troughs of economic cycles and market tumult, and so to give a better long-term reckoning.however in a very venerablecape ratioexplainer formonevatori wrote: cyclically-adjusted pes may be a useful tool, but i don t think they re the silver bullet they re sometimes touted as.read that post to learn more about cyclically-adjusted p/e ratios. then push on for more thoughts about how much to really care about what they are saying.so what is the ratio suggesting now?going by the shiller-flavoured pe ratio, yes the us market looks very expensive:source:multplthe last time we approached these levels was on the eve of the dotcom crash. even our youngest readers will have heard aboutwhat happened then. if you re ever going to judge it be squeaky-bum time on the basis of p/e ratios then now is the time, at least when it comes to us stocks.last week i included a similar graph in mymogulspost. the ratio was below 40 then, so we ve already pushed above it.it s not inconceivable the ratio could moderate without a bust. perhaps advances in ai really will unlock huge productivity gains and boost earnings beyond all imagining. maybe it could even do that, somehow, without simultaneously capsizing the rest of the economy and its incumbents.either way, the justification for using long-term cyclically-adjusted valuation multiples is we ve heard this sort of story many times before   railroads, mainframes, biotech, internet stocks   and it tends to end the same way. excess followed by retrenchment. the results are in that graph.people thought it was different those previous times, too. and it generally was in some ways, as far as society is concerned.but for stock market investors it mostly wasn t.can market levels or valuation help with market timing?again yes and no. but mostly no.while confident-sounding pundits and bloggers are forever mining and showing off new indicators, the consensus of the academic research is that even the cyclically-adjusted ratio is a lousy timing tool.nobel prize-winning professor robert shiller   who gave his name to one flavour of such ratios   has saidmuch the same thingin the past.also, you ll notice i said  academic research . finding cute ratios or indicators in a dataset and ruthlessly applying them in a model is one thing. actually implementing this stuff in real and crazy life   when markets are ripping or swan-diving   is another.perhaps that s a good thing.this is survivorship bias and anecdote speaking of course, but i d bet more money has been lost this century by people too scared of investing in appropriate size after the dotcom bust and the financial crisis than by those who took a pounding and supposedly sold at the bottom of abear, never to return.still, a high cyclically-adjusted p/e ratio has ultimately been shown to be the best of a bad bunch of potential indicators when it comes to estimating future returns.again that  best  is doing the heavy lifting. a vanguardstudyfound the ratio had historically explained about 40% of future returns. better than the alternatives, but that still left 60% of returns to account for.you shilly boywant more evidence? the article i linked to above where shiller warned that his ten-year cyclically-adjusted ratio wasn t a timing tool hails from 2014.in that same piece shiller nevertheless opined that when it came to us stocks, it looks like a peak .the us is up about four-fold since then. i imagine he s glad he hedged his bets.this market timing stuff isn t easy. it s either hard or not possible.certainly it only looks easy in hindsight. but people predict crashes literally all the time, so someone will sometimes be proved right, even by chance, and they will later dine out on it. so it goes.incidentally if you re thinking it is easy if you study fibonnacci levels or kondratiev waves   in other wordstechnical analysis  then (a) i m skeptical and (b) this isn t the article for you and (c) i still reckon if it ever works then that it sonly obvious in hindsight. withknobs on!proof that most methods of making stock market predictions don t work.market timing for passive investorsmany readers assumemonevatoris against all forms of market-timing, second-guessing, or risk management through portfolio reshuffling.however that puts our position far too dogmatically.for a start i m in the mix. i m anactive investorand i m all too happy chopping and changing around.the key for me   and a suggestion i d make to other active investors   is to at least try to understand the risks and downsides of carrying on this way. think performance chasing, loss aversion, excessive costs, fomo, over-confidence, and a gamut of other behavioural and mathematical reasons why churning your portfolio willy-nilly is probably not the route to riches. know the rules before you break them.so much for active investors. butmonevatorsuggestspassive investingin index funds is the best approach for most readers. so that s the real question. not how well i m taming my overactive chimp brain from one day to the next.fair  but my passively-minded co-bloggerthe accumulatoris also quite pragmatic about such matters.passive up to a pointfor example,tahas tweaked ourslow & steady passive portfolioseveral times. and he s not shown himself to be averse to trying to swerve from egregiously expensive markets, either. think of hisclassic postin 2016 warning of the risks baked into index-linked gilts.however taking action should never be the default for passive investors. quite the opposite: don t just do something   stand there!astawrites: how do you tell when the moment has come for legit evasive manoeuvres   as opposed to the standard knee-jerk fiddling that just amounts to ill-advised market timing?i think the trigger for positive action is when we re approaching amarket extreme.the mental image that illustrates such a moment for me is the death star moving into firing position against the rebels instar wars.the battle station slowly rounds the intervening gas giant that stands between the good guys and planet-killing laser death you don t get that kind of imagery in corporate emails from your broker, eh?read on for more (alleged) heresy for passive investors:when is it okay for passive investors to time the market?is now a good time to invest?for slam dunk proof thatmonevatordoes discuss these issues, my co-blogger talked about market timing only two months ago.the accumulatorwrote:it s because equities have proven resilient over time that long-term investors stay in the market, regardless of short-term wobbles.trying to predict the perfect entry point often means missing out on growth because there is never a  safe  time to invest.i d add that you should always think about your time horizon when making decisions. we can t predict the future, but thebalance of probabilitiesover different time frames means the answer to whether you can reasonably be fully exposed to us equities today is different if you re 30 compared to if you re 60.is now a good time to invest?some things to do if you re worriedover the past decade or so, a lot of the returns from equities   and nearly all the (apparent) froth   is down to technology stocks. at least with respect to companies big enough to move the index dial.and because the technology sector is to the us stock market what the originalstar warstrilogy is to the nine episodestar warscanon   that is, only a third of the total but delivering most of the gains   the us markets have been the ones most affected by the long boom in tech.oh, and there may be an ai bubble in progress. or an ai revolution. pick a side!at least this focus on us tech affords us an easy way to reduce exposure to what seems to be an expensive stock market: we can dial down tech and/or us stocks.i wroteabout this formonevatormembers:we saw how us equities dominate global index funds and how a handful of giant tech/growth companies in turn comprise a large chunk of the us market.one counter then would be to hold a wider spread of us companies.you could track an equally-weighted index, for instance, instead of a market cap-weighted one. you could reduce your exposure to larger us growth stocks and add small or mid cap us shares or us value stocks.there are countless options.the snag? only that i wrote that in march 2024. since then the s&p 500 is up another 30% or so.i have my defences. my members  post is several thousand words long, for one thing. it belabours the uncertainty, and it explicitly says staying invested and letting the market decide is a perfectly rational plan for passive investors. i also even note that doubling down on tech and trying to maximise exposure to the rally (/bubble) could be a justifiable thing for active investors to do, too.also my article never said  get out of stocks . on the contrary it said: whatever you do don t sell all your equities!baby steps is the way forward. it s one thing to modestly tilt away from what may be an extreme in a particular market. it s another to start making all-in and all-out bets.in my piece i made a case for more diversification into global stocks   which since march 2024 have done fine, and even better than fine in pound terms   and for shifting to track equal-weighted or value-tilted us indices, to reduce your giant tech exposure.in doing so investors who underweighted us stocks in early 2024 could still be sitting pretty today is my point   even as us tech has continued its icarus ascent. so i ve no regrets.besides, when people fret about the us markets diving, i don t think they re concerned with maximising short-term gains. they are fretful about a dotcom-style wipeout of their portfolio.that s certainly my perspective, and i ve been underweight us stocks for at least 18 months now.what to do if you re queasy about the us stock marketother than equitiesthe other thing i reminded readers in my 2024 article is that equities   be they us or otherwise   are not the only fruit:why not simply reduce your overall equity risk? you curb how badly a us market correction would hit your wealth, without trying to pick favourites among the different regions.the standard way to alter risk levels with a passive portfolio is just to reduce your equity allocation and increase your bond allocation. (bonds that are finally set to deliver reasonable returns again, after their big price reset.)if you were invested 80% in equities and 20% bonds   an 80/20 split   then you could shift to a 60/40 split, for example.again, endless permutations.now it s true government bonds haven t seen much of a recovery from the post-2022 wreckage. but as we veexplained before, that smash-up left them in a far stronger starting place todeliver decent returnsin future. expected returns are very positive, compared to negative in the years running up to 2022.meanwhile corporate and high-yield bonds have been going great guns, thanks to low defaults and relatively high income payouts.such bonds would be hot potatoes to hold in a recession, true. but they d probably do okay in a stock market correction driven by a hype-cycle bursting. particularly if the us cut rates to help steady the ship.needless to say gold has been an excellent diversifier of late. how much farther its stupendous rally can run is well above my pay grade   and outside the scope of this article!why a diversified portfolio needs more than stocks and bondsbubble bathironically, one reason not to panic over whether we re in a stock market bubble is the way that nearly everyone seems to believe we are.you can barely turn onbloombergorcnbc, read an investing newsletter, or talk to a fellow private investor online or off without hearing that we re in a crazy ai bubble that the unwashed masses cannot see for what it is.here s what google trends has to say about the popularity of the search term  stock market bubble :source:googlewhen the masses all think that we re in a bubble, then it s definitionally difficult to believe that we are.time will tell. personally i think stuff looks peaky, and i ve said so today and elsewhere. but i m still 75%  risk-on  in my portfolio currently. just not too much us market risk   not 50%, let alone 70%-plus.i m even still exposed to tech stocks. mostly through my own stock-picking though. and i m very (very) underweight the magnificent seven. but i m sure i ll take a tumble anyway if the us market falls.it usually pays to be humble as an investor. lifelong passive investors who believe they can spot a bubble better than the market might want to ponder that.

large (like sell 100% of equites in my sipp invested 100% in equities ) allocation shifts thinking i could time the market and lived to regret it.and when i first started saving i sat out the late 90s rally thinking a bubble was forming. yes there was a correction in 97 following the asian crisis. while it gave me a warm fuzzy feeling to be holding cash when every stock on ceefax was red, it was short lived. surprise surprise the market didn t fall back to 94 levels. it s quite hard sitting on a pile of cash when the market continues to go up.but now older (and hopefully wiser) these experience have been helpful to prompt some soul-searching as to why did i want to get out , or not want to get in, in the first place.the answer is that i didn t really have appetite to lose what a 100% equity portfolio exposes you to.the max historical drawdowns of a 100% equity portfolio would crater my retirement plans.so over the last 5 the clan have been tilting away from pushing 90% equities and now much closer to 55% equities.within equities tilting away from na too. this time i ve not gone  all in  (or should that be  all out ?). i keep top-slicing the gains on the world trackers in my sipp and then investing in bonds cash or world ex-us.psychologically doing a little makes a huge difference and less likely to take action you may live to regret doing a lot.3johnoctober 10, 2025, 8:10 amworth remembering that the global etf mentioned is developed world only, excluding countries like china. easily possible to drop us exposure somewhat by having an all world global tracker such as vwrp. us stocks make up 60.55% of that.4shermooctober 10, 2025, 8:25 amwell timed article, i ve had this conversation about an ai bubble with several friends, some retired, some close to fire, others a long way off.i think firstly where you are on your journey is most important, i m very much a passive investor at this point but i d suggest if you re retired and things might be tight it s worth thinking about your risk of a crash, if you re young and still growing your pot just keep feeding your cash into a global tracker and if there is a big crash make sure you keep feeding in your regular savings into the dip.personally i m slowly shifting my stocks exposure anyway as i get closer to fire, but i think i ll keep my main fund as it is, vanguard esg developed world all cap.i know people that thought the market was overpriced 18 months ago and shifted a lot to cash / bonds, they ve missed out on over 20% of growth.5b. lackdownoctober 10, 2025, 8:54 ami am at an age where  we are all dead in the long run  begins to outweigh  stock markets always recover in the long run . i know of retirements which were destroyed (not just postponed or impoverished) in 2008 and i find that current annuity rates will pay north of 5% rpi linked for a 64 year old not obviously dying of anything. buying one as an income floor abolishes in one go fear of longevity of inflation and of market crashes.it was of course a side effect of 2008 that annuities were off the table for over a decade. i don t understand economics enough to know whether gfc 2026

dilutionmaven6marc1485153october 10, 2025, 9:39 amthe vast majority seem to be calling it a bubble that s going to crash, so the contrarian in me thinks we ll probably get a  melt up  instead.personally, i have increased our (wife and i) allocation to cash in taxable accounts, but maintained 100% equities in tax sheltered accounts. cash is approaching 15% now. i prefer cash to bonds because my wife is a non earner so can earn up to about 18k on cash tax free, making it a lot more attractive.will continue to utilise all tax sheltered allowances with 100% equities. if we have a drop i ll probably move all the cash into vwrl in gia.7the investoroctober 10, 2025, 9:52 am@rhino   ack, thanks. i had double vision when i posted this one around midnight 8catkinoctober 10, 2025, 10:39 ama fantastic article (as always) thank you. well, this passive investor did indeed get a little bit active yesterday afternoon.i was all-in on vhvg vanguard ftse developed world acc and have swapped for vanguard lifestrategy 60% equity acc.to give some context, i am 48 and have been coast fire for 5 years. i would like to have the option to fully retire at 58. while i am certain that i would not have sold in the event of a market meltdown, i know that i would have then had to fret for goodness knows how many years (2? 20?) about how long the market might take to recover. and just in general terms it felt uncomfortable to be betting my retirement on the promises of a handful of tech bros.i have to say that i am not particularly happy with my new lifestrategy fund   it feels too cautious and it is difficult to like being in bonds   but i figure it is a pretty safe place to stand around doing nothing for a little while while i figure out what might suit me better.i d love to know what others think of my move.maven9azaminooctober 10, 2025, 11:36 amalmost more impressed that you managed to write the whole article without quoting peter lynch than by the article itself! far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves mogul10hariseldonoctober 10, 2025, 11:45 amperhaps a better time period to look at is the late 80 s when thinking about a concentrated world index, we saw japan reach around 45% of the market versus about 30% for the usa, japan fell heavily in 89 but when you look at index levels from 1988 to about 1992, yes there was drop for an odd year or so, but the market as a whole did just fine.i think any predictions made in 1988 about a potential catastrophic fall in japanese equities would have been far more gloomy than the actual outcome markets will surprise us, with hindsight we will tell a good story of how it happened and why market timing is tough but a gentle nudge in the risk levels of a portfolio makes us feel better !11dazzleoctober 10, 2025, 12:34 pmwhat a time to be approaching re!pull the plug now, or go for yet more omy?will i be fine, probably, am i scared definitely.am i going to pull the plug at an all-time high, with doom signals all around?but, most days in a stock market are an all-time high, it s normal. it s easy and  smart  to predict doom. doing nothing is usually better than doing something. i only have 1 life, should i live it scared but unhappy?what am i doing, pulling more and more, in slices, out of equity and into cash.when the trump tariffs happened i was just about to start moving out but hadn t actioned anything. i was then reluctant to sell  low  and said i d wait for a recovery   when said recovery came over the summer i started, and have continued. if feel odd to be holding so much cash (still in isa / pension wrappers as cash funds) but i tell myself they are paying 4% or so and that is enough. current plan is to get to  some  years  worth of spending (i was thinking 3 but am now tending to 5) into cash and then leave the equities to do what it does. at the most that is 22% cash.i don t have so much that i can move all to safe funds, i need the market to do what it does: rise. that is what it has always done but it sure feels scary.my mrs has a financial adviser and he was encouraging her to get out of her passive all world fund with just this  market is very toppy, highly exposed to us tech  talk. he wants to move her to a 75%/25% equity active fund. it has 0.6% ocf and screams against my passive instincts.i seem to recall, but can t find, an ermine post along the lines of  what are we doing up here  about the markets being very high. i think that was a while back when they were far lower   i m hoping he might pop by and point me to that article.mogul12bassavoceoctober 10, 2025, 1:01 pmwhen the market is rising fomo is everywhere, when the market looks

you ve done the right thing for the right reasons.@dazzle   it does make sense to diversify if your good lady is 100% equities. no need to buy an expensive active fund to execute that manoeuvre of

stumbling on monevator in the mid-2000 s, and after reading mcclung and closely following ta s cat food series, i was convinced i was going to happily remain so until the end (although the dynamic withdrawal strategy would mean a ratio shift throughout retirement).however, as i may be fi now and within 1-2 years of re as the stormclouds gather, i ve realised that i have zero issue missing out on any growth in the next months/years before the correction happens, in return for a bit less pain when it happens. i ve only made a relatively modest change to 50/50 but it still took me a while to press the button! equities 50% us now too, so not as concentrated as i was.i imagine i ll dial it back up post-correction (but understand that will be difficult to call at the time too!). cheers

yourself, what will that omy buy you? you re running out of summat else mate, one day every 24 hours. heed that above all else.the moving finger writes; and, having writ,moves on: nor all thy piety nor witshall lure it back to cancel half a line,if it helps you any. i surrendered eight years of working. i was a sour puss for a long time for the money i could have earned, sold short, because i realised the price of working was high. when you find yourself in a doctor s surgery askinghow did i get from here to thereit sharpens the mind.the fire burned low, i read some of my earlier work and yes, what has once been lost can never be regained. and yet:i have just cleared recovering the real equivalent of the eight years salary i gave up. i can now honestly say je ne regrette rien, this was after giving a significant amount of money away. but i was not a good passivista, i took bonkers chances, i got away with enough to clean up the mess of losing a quarter of my working life to frailtyi was skint for many years that i lived in fear, always falling back, falling back, and hoping for the burned out engines to restart. that was rough.the period after pulling the plug will always be high on regret and what-iffery. but beware. i have been fortunate, because i pulled the plug before this happened to me. i saw people push themselves too hard and into ill health, heart attacks and the like, because tragically your 50s isn t like your 40s, things catch up with you then, above all else stress. you can t buy health, no matter what you pay. i did buy some, by losing weight, by watching birds rather than the screen in the office, by walking rather than stuck on my backside in the office.but i also gotto do thisand i ve done little bits of it since. because i was given the gift of grace, and there is only one thing you can do with grace, pass it on. when you have heard the engines fail, but you heard the buggers restart at the low water mark, you have heard grace, and i mean that in a humanistic, not religious sense.you can do it. omy will not save you. 2my will not save you. to thine self be true. what do you hear, in the whisper in the wind? it must determine your choices. if you re hard enough to carry on working, well , knock yourself out.i burned too much of my life force seeking security, but i heard the siren song of grace, and it sharpened the edge. i believed i was burned out, but i was able to make enough to pull enough myself and others out of the mire after the low-water mark, and clear the lost energy.i have been lucky. i took too many chances. but i will stick my neck out and suggest 60/40 will not hold true in the years to come. i totally respect ti s choice if he busts my ass for the heresy. but the west is clearly in serious decline. ai will not save its tail imo. but that s purely imo, it s worth exactly what you paid for it.the switch from working to not working is big, and for many people it s a one-way ticket, a leap

(#11)re: omy. imv, retirement is all about securing core income with a large degree of certainty   there are a few instruments that will do this free from market and inflation risk (other forms of risk do exist!), e.g., rpi annuities, collapsing inflation linked gilt ladders, db pensions (if rpi linked without a cap), and the state pension.as an example, if you are too young for annuities, then a 15 year linker ladder supplying the equivalent of two state pensions can be currently constructed for about  325k (a 30 year ladder would be  550k).the problem with relying on cash is that real future returns are unknown   during the recent inflation peak of 10%, easy access accounts peaked at 6%(?) or so for a real loss.to add to what @ermine (#22) saidi took retirement 6 years ago despite 7 years of actuarial reductions on my db pension and missing out on the increase in payments that additional years of service would have made and missing out on additional contributions to dc pensions and savings because a) we had enough income to cover all of our core expenditure and most of our adaptive expenditure (withdrawals from the portfolio tops up the latter) and b) i d had enough of work because the toll of continually trying to do more with less eventually hit my health (it took 2 years or more after retirement to recover from work).@xxd09 (#18)we have a slightly more complicated portfolio than you (2xequity, 2xbond, 1xgold, plus fixed term cash accounts) but no unplanned moves so far. i try to limit  tinkering  to the fixed income portfolio of the portfolio since it a) scratches an itch, and b) will probably do little harm.mogul29andy dufresneoctober 11, 2025, 11:00 amti- thanks for posting this one in particular. very timely food for thought30semipassiveoctober 11, 2025, 12:13 pmi ve been looking at the ray dalio all weather portfolio again more recently. i have been dialling up my bond exposure for the last couple of years, having had zero long dated gilts prior to that.but 40% in long dated govt bonds does seem like an awful lot (i am at 20% for info across a couple of gilts but will hold to maturity).the rest of my fixed income allocation is a mix of corporate ig, high yield, and even an em $ bond etf. a bit of everything really.i m still accumulating for another year, i may even add some of this recently issued t56 gilt (5.375% coupon!) but how long can we keep issuing debt at this yield before we go bankrupt?they must have been desperate to even consider a 30 year issue at that level.mogul31delta hedgeoctober 11, 2025, 12:13 pma great piece @ti, and one well worth you burning the midnight oil for on thursday  99% of what i think on this is under the comments in either the  what to do if your queasy about the us stock market  members  piece, which you link to above, or (for ai  bubble  fears), in the  first they came for the call centres  w/e reading piece, both of which are from last year.as to the other 1%:  cape s flashing red on us markets, but as you say, timing s a mug s game, and humility rules. i m tilting global too, trimming us equity to ~40% (or even slightly less now with some gold and silver mining etf top up buying last week) and leaning on em and scv overweights.  emh s weak and semi-strong forms hold some water. prices reflect info fast (but not always   it took days for markets to react to the deepseek announcement, bit like with the wright brothers and the kitty hawk) making consistent outperformance a unicorn hunt.  yet, weak emh skeptics like shiller point to bubbles persisting (ai s dotcom d j  vu?), so i m hedging with bonds (synthetically via wgec etf), with trend following (from winton enhanced global equity, with 100% fx +commodities tf and 100% global equity overlay) and with some sprinklings of gold/pme and related miner its, with broad commodity etf and deep value energy producer it (and direct) exposures.so, @ermine all weather-style, but much more equity heavy, and also return stacked/capital efficient.  bridgewater s data shows awp cut drawdowns 30 50% in crashes like  08, balancing risk without killing returns. still, rebalancing isn t quite a free lunch, and low yield eras sting.  for young investors, just starting out, there s nowt to fear from a crash and much to welcome. for them it s a case of just keep dcaing. rather than timing the market just adjust the dca amount. so if you have 100 pcm to invest (using round illustrative no s) put 50 pcm in when the index is within 20% of its 52 week high. when it falls below 20% off that high then put 150 pcm in until the surplus funds (the 100 pcm you ve set aside less the 50 pcm you put in when within 20%) are either exhausted (and then go back to 100 pcm) or until the index moves within 20% of the past year high (and then revert to 50 pcm).  for those oldies with large amounts invested already, then current us valuation concerns are obviously more of a dilemma than for the young turks just starting out on their investing journey. for them, on lsi vs. dca, vanguard s right. lsi wins ~66% of the time, capturing bull runs like the s&p 500 s 10.58% annualized return (jan 1926 sep 2025). time heals corrections; post 1907, 1929, 1972, 1987, 1999, 2007, 2020, 2022 and april 2025 crashes all recovered (albeit some quicker than others), if you stayed put. dca s a comfort blanket, but time in the market always totally trumps timing.  dynamic asset allocation tempt shifting weights based on cape or momentum but b&h s simplicity often edges out, avoiding fees and missteps. cape s backward looking; forward metrics like earnings growth or combined metrics might better gauge future returns, which hinge on tomorrow s performance, not past glory or woe.  mean reversion s been king historically, alongside momentum, pulling overvalued markets back to earth. but passive flows and market structure shifts (like index funds  dominance or the inelastic markets hypothesis where demand drives prices beyond fundamentals) might dampen this. if etfs keep gobbling assets, valuations could stay stretched, as buying pressure ignores  value .cheers for the keeping on delivering the steady wisdom @team monevator  32rauloctober 11, 2025, 1:10 pmmarkets climb a wall of worry, as they say.i think switching to non us markets won t give you much protection against a us crash, every market

touch conservative for some at 36, but you swerved the 2022 bond wreck switching now that gilts look better value, and have potential gilt powder to rebalance if/when equity does correct (though perhaps define rebalancing rules now to help later).i was in your situation until 40/41 at 100% which felt comfortable with good earnings. once the pot grows to a level where you feel it needs to be protected, attitude can change.happily 80/20 at the moment (age 42), though this was partly a glide down due to being 7 years from fire rather than concerns about the market.mogul39rosariooctober 14,

different matter. rather than assess my required level of defensive assets based on a percentage of the portfolio, i m assessing based on annual burn rate. looking to build to 5 years spending in reserve before i m 50, currently 2.i pretty much view the defensive part of my portfolio as an emergency fund at the moment. however, i m prepared that over time my mentality could well change into a more defensive stance. especially if nett worth grows quickly and i look to wind back earnings / contributions.cancel replyleave a commentname*email*websitecommentnotify me of followup comments via

employees in the september quarter, bringing the total workforce down to 5.9 lakh   its sharpest drop on record and steeper than market expectations.the decline was driven by planned reductions, performance-related exits, and bench policy adjustments involving new hires. the company also incurred rs 1,135 crore in restructuring charges related to severance costs. tcs said it will continue the workforce reduction exercise throughout the year without targeting a specific number.earlier, tcs announced plans to reduce around 2% of its workforce (over 12,000 employees) this year, with the cuts primarily affecting mid-level and senior executives. tcs came under the spotlight following a social media uproar overlayoffs, seen as part of the indian it major's broader strategic shift toward emerging areas such as ai, data, and cybersecurity, while phasing out roles that cannot be redeployed within the firm.\"we have released about 1% of our workforce, mainly at mid and senior levels, due to skill and capability mismatches. impacted employees are being provided with benefits, counselling, and outplacement support, along with severance packages above industry standards.additionally, there was some involuntary attrition as part of our regular performance and bench policy reviews involving new hires,\" said sudeep kunnumal, chief human resources officer in tcs, during the analyst call on thursday.tcs updated its associate deployment policy, which mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually, restricting their bench time to a maximum of 35 business days each year.tcs ceo krithivasan said, \"we will continue this exercise throughout the year. at the same time, we are not chasing a particular number here. so whenever we are paying (redundancy charges), we will take the charge appropriately in the next two quarters,\" he said.the company reported a sequential constant currency growth of 0.8% and a year-on-year decline of 3.3% for the september quarter. in dollar terms, revenue rose to $7.4 billion, up 0.6% sequentially, adding only $45 million in incremental revenue.the modest increase underscores a muted demand environment, with growth constrained by subdued client sentiment and reduced discretionary spending. tcs's performance was a tad better than in the june quarter when its revenue fell 3.1% year-on-year in constant currency and 3.3% sequentially, as geopolitical uncertainties dampened demand.in the september quarter, growth was driven by growth in life sciences and healthcare leading with a 3.4% rise, while technology and services, manufacturing, and banking and financial services grew modestly at 1.8%, 1.6%, and 1.1% respectively. the company reported a total contract value (tcv) of $10 billion, which grew 6.5% sequentially and 16% year-on-year. \"lingering uncertainties in the broader economic environment continue to remain a key challenge.companies are keeping tight control over discretionary budgets in response to economic and demand volatility.you can also check:bengaluru aqi|weather in bengaluru|gold rate today in bengaluru|silver rate today in bengaluruclients are consolidating vendors to achieve transformation objectives effectively and efficiently. we are finding good success in many such large deals using our differentiated ai-infused solutions,\" krithivasan said. its operating margin expanded by 70 basis points sequentially to 25.2%, reflecting cost management and operational discipline.its cfo samir seksaria said currency movements supported margins by 80 basis points, while the wage hike effective september 1, along with additional quarterly variable allowances, had a negative impact of 70 basis points. these effects were partly offset by a 40-basis-point gain from pyramid rebalancing and a 20-basis-point improvement from operational efficiencies. \"we have the strongest ability to absorb market fluctuations and competitive pressures.second, growth when achieved through value creation and innovation will have a positive impact on margins over time. we continue to work towards getting back to our aspirational band of 26 to 28%,\" seksaria told analysts. amid tariff uncertainty and new h-1b regulations in the us, north america remained largely flat, recording only 0.8% constant currency growth over the previous quarter. the uk saw a decline of 1.4%, while continental europe grew 1.4%. tcs remains largely unaffected by us visa policy changes, with only around 500 h-1b employees based in the country.get the latest lifestyle updates on times of india,

    "text": "there has been lots of chatter about this year's nobel prizes, with some speculating that us president donald trump could receive the peace award   including mr trump himself.the possibility of the nobel peace prize being awarded to the us president has sparked debate on social media, putting a bigger spotlight on the award than in previous years.as we wait for the announcement on friday night, let's unpack how the awards work.what are the nobel prizes?it's the umbrella term for a group of prestigious, multidisciplinary prizes established by wealthy swedish chemist, inventor and businessman alfred nobel.dr nobel bequeathed his fortune to reward people who have \"conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,\" with the first nobel prizes awarded in 1901.there are six categories:physicschemistryphysiology or medicineliteraturepeaceeconomic scienceswhen is the nobel peace prize announced?tonight.the recipient of the prize will be announced in norway's capital, oslo, at 11am on friday, local time   which is8pm aedt.however, the prizes won't be awarded until a ceremony on december 10, which marks the anniversary of mr nobel's death.five of the prizes are presented at a ceremony in stockholm, sweden, but the nobel peace prize is awarded in oslo, norway, because of a stipulation in mr nobel's will.donald trump has been nominated for the nobel peace prize.(ap: jae c. hong)what does the nobel peace prize winner get?the winner is presented witha medal,a diplomaand11 million swedish krona ($1.8 million).while all nobel prize medals feature dr nobel, the peace medal is slightly different.designed by norwegian sculptor gustav vigeland, it shows mr nobel in a different pose.what are the nobel peace prize criteria?there are no specific criteria for the nobel peace prize.instead, nominees arejudged according to stipulations listed in dr nobel's will, which state that the award should go to the person who has done:\" the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"on its website, the committee says that, since world war ii, the prize has been awarded in recognition of efforts in four key areas:arms control and disarmamentpeace negotiationdemocracy and human rightswork aimed at creating a better-organised and more peaceful world\"the nobel peace prize is a bit different [to the other prizes] because good deeds, being a good person, doing the right thing, is what we are looking for,\"norwegian nobel committee member asle toje explained on the nobel prize website in 2022.\"we're not looking for pound-by-pound intelligence.\"who decides the nobel peace prize winner?a committee offive people, elected by the norwegian parliament, selects the recipient   another stipulation made in mr nobel's will.however, sitting members of the norwegian parliament aren't eligible to serve on the committee.still, norwegian news sitenewsinenglish.no points out that three of the five current members are longtime politicians.the current committee is:j rgen watne frydnes:known for his humanitarian work, including pen international, an organisation dedicated to protecting freedom of expressionasle toje:a foreign policy analyst with a doctorate in international relationsanne enger:a former leader of norway's center party who fronted a successful campaign against norway joining the european union in the 90skristin clemet:a former education minister for norway's conservative partygry larsen:a former norwegian state secretary for the labour partykristian berg harpviken is listed as the committee's secretary. he participates in the deliberations but does not vote on the winner.the committee is assisted by permanent advisers and other norwegian or international experts,according to the nobel prize website.anne enger (left), kristian berg harpviken, gry larsen, kristin clemet, asle toje and j rgen watne frydnes.(supplied: nobel prize outreach/geir anders rybakken  rslien)how do they decide the nobel peace prize winner?the committee reviews all the nominations andcomes up with a shortlist.\"we do it pretty much the same way that you make a good sauce   you reduce and reduce and reduce,\"mr toje explained.\"the process starts bycutting out names that are spurious or that don't pique the interest of the members or that don't clearly coincide with the criteriain the testament.\"after a series of meetings, we get to the really exciting stuff, and that's when we're down to a dozen or so names.\"then, a group of advisers   selected \"on the basis of their professional experience and academic expertise\"   puttogether individual reports on the shortlisted candidates.the committee members reconvene to review the reports, which can result in requests for further information on various candidates.\"when we get down to a dozen or so names, we reach out to the world because, whatever you're interested in, somebody somewhere has written a phd about it,\" mr toje said.\"we try to get the best information possible   not because we're looking to confirm our biases or to look for black marks, but the committee really tends to prefer to know it all, the good and the bad, in order to make an informed decision.\"they eventuallynarrow the list down to a \"very small group,\"thenhold a simple majority vote  a decision that cannot be appealed.who has been nominated?there are 339 candidates nominated for the prize   244 individuals and 95 organisations.the committee keeps the full list of nominees secretfor 50 years.however, nominators are allowed to publicly reveal who they've put forward for the award.so far, we know thatjailed hong kong activist chow hang-tungandcanadian human rights lawyer irwin cotlerare among the nominees.mr trumphas been touted as a possible contender for this year's prize, witha nomination from fellow republican claudia tenney   reportedly submitted a day before the january 31 deadline  making him eligible.the leaders of cambodia, israel and pakistan have also said they nominated mr trump.who can nominate someone for a nobel peace prize?first off,you can't nominate yourself.and not just anyone can nominate someone for a nobel prize  nominators must meet certain criteria.that includes being a member of a national government, a university professor, or a former prize winner, among other things.who won the 2024 nobel peace prize?last year's award went to an organisation called nihon hidankyo.it was founded by the survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and has long campaigned against the use of nuclear weapons.the organisation was recognised for \"its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again,\"according to the nobel prize website.nihon hidankyo was presented with last year's nobel peace prize.(ap: kin cheung)past nobel peace prize controversiesnelson mandelaformer south africa president nelson mandela.(getty: per-anders pettersson)while the nobel peace prize has often been controversial, most people agreed in 1993 that nelson mandela winning the award was \"self-evident\", according to geir lundestad, the then-secretary of the norwegian nobel committee.mandela, who spent 27 years in prison, called for a peaceful transition to end apartheid in south africa.what was not self-evident was awarding the prize jointly with frederik willem de klerk, the last white leader of south africa, lundestad said in his 2015 memoir.many said mandela should have won alone, while others said he could not make peace without a counterpart, lundestad recounted.in the end, the prize was given to both to encourage the peaceful transition to a democratic south africa   a process that was not yet complete at the time of the award.henry kissinger and le duc thoformer secretary of state and nobel peace prize winner henry kissinger.(us library of congress)among the most controversial awards is the 1973 honouring of top us diplomat henry kissinger and north vietnam's le duc tho for reaching the january 1973 paris peace accords, under which washington completed a military withdrawal from south vietnam.the committee's decision shocked many at the time as mr kissinger played a major role in us military strategy in the final stages of the 1955-75 vietnam war.le duc tho refused the prize on the grounds that peace had not yet been established. two of the five committee members resigned in protest.mr kissinger, while accepting the award, did not travel to norway for the ceremony and later tried in vain to return the prize.internal documents released in 2023 showed the then-committee gave the award in the full knowledge that the vietnam war was unlikely to end anytime soon.aung san suu kyimyanmar state counselor aung san suu kyi in 2017.(reuters: athit perawongmetha/file)one of the few women awarded the prize, suu kyi was one of a string of human rights campaigners to win in the 90s.she was nominated for her non-violent struggle for democracy against the military dictatorship in myanmar.for years, she was hailed as one of the most worthy recipients of the award, but that changed in 2017 when, during her leadership of the civilian government,the myanmar military carried out mass killings and gang rapes \"with genocidal intent\" against the rohingya muslim, according to a united nations investigation.in 2021, following a military coup, suu kyi was arrested again. the 80-year-old has been detained ever since and her health is ailing, according to her son.mahatma gandhimahatma ghandi did not win a nobel peace prize.(supplied: immigration museum)gandhi never won the peace prize.he was on the committee's internal discussion list of candidates on five different occasions, with the body prepared to award it to him in 1948, the year he was assassinated, according to lundestad.the committee had the option to give him the prize posthumously, which was possible at the time but is no longer.according to lundestad, it may be because the committee did not want to offend norway's close ally britain, the former colonial power in india, or because the politics of gandhi may have been perceived as too \"foreign\" or \"anti-modern\" by members of a europe-centric committee.the violence of india's partition could also have played a part, he said. at least 1 million people were killed, and 15 million were uprooted.in any case, \"among the omissions, mahatma gandhi stands in a class of his own\", wrote lundestad in his memoir. \"it is, of course, extremely unfortunate that the 20th century's leading spokesman for non-violence never received the nobel peace prize\".abc with reutersposted9 oct 20259 oct 2025thu 9 oct 2025 at 10:17pm,updated10 oct 202510 oct 2025fri 10 oct 2025 at

(greene later distanced herself from the comments but did not deny having written them.)oh how things change. after nearly five years in congress, the hard-right north georgia representative is calling for an extension of provisions in the affordable care act, obama s signature health-care policy, breaking with her party over the central policy issue of the currentgovernment shutdownand creating ripples of anxiety throughout the broader maga movement.  i m absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will double if the tax credits expire this year,  she wroteon x. today, greene put theblamefor the government shutdown squarely on republican leadership. (greene s office did not respond to a request to comment on some of her recent statements.)greene is no democrat: she believes that obamacare created many of the problems with today s health-insurance market, but she also believes that republicans  have no new solution.  lately, her impulse to go after both sides has left her very much on her own.her sudden criticism of republicans  approach to health care comes after a summer of minor defections from the far-right political milieu. in june, while many republicans were throwing their full support behind israel in its war against hamas in gaza, greene became the first republican congressperson to call israel s actions a  genocide.  and whereas the white house has tried to put an end tothe discussionabout the sex offender and former donald trump associate jeffrey epstein, greene has pushed for transparency, supporting apetitionto force a vote on the release of information about individuals connected to epstein (the other backers have largely been democratic house members). she has also continued to champion oddball issues that few others in congress seem to care about. herclear skies act, for example, doubles down on greene s statedbeliefthat  they  control the weather. jury s out on who  they  are.neither the white house nor congressional leaders have been shy about expressing frustration with greene s heel turn.  what s going on with marjorie?  trump reportedly asked at leasttwo different senior republicans. speaker of the house mike johnson, whom greene tried to oust from congress last year, alluded to the idea that greene doesn t have all the facts.  not everyone knows everything,  he said during apress briefing.democrats, however, are praising greene for her new stances.  you are going to hear me utter words i never thought i d say,  saidsenator raphael warnock of georgia.  marjorie taylor greene is right. when she first ran for congress, greene was more known for her fanatical adherence to the qanon conspiracy theory than for her vision for sound policy. even as she was publicly praising trump from afar during her campaign, greene didn t receive the president s endorsement right away she was well on her way to winning before he threw his support behind her. greene has hewed closely to the maga movement during her time in congress, even after the white housereportedlydiscouraged her from attempting a senate run this past spring and neglected to give her acabinet position. but she insists that she is still a free thinker:  i m not some sort of blind slave to the president,  greene toldnbc newsthis week.  i got elected without the president s endorsement, and i think that has served me really well. the question is whether greene s actions are the result of genuine disenchantment with the congressional gop and its mode of governing an expression of the anti-establishment spirit that got her elected in the first place or just political maneuvering. her political calculations may have to do with the fact that an estimated2.3 milliongeorgians signed up for obamacare from 2014 to 2024 one of the highest numbers of any state.  it s as authentic as anything is in congress,  my colleague mark leibovich told me of greene s recent moves.  whether it s a heel turn, or whether it s acalculatedheel turn,  he isn t yet sure.  and i don t pretend to understand her thought process.  still, he said, her ideological independence has  gotten her pretty far in a pretty short period of time : not every representative secures asubcommittee chairmanshipso quickly.upstart political candidates in the gop broadly understand that their potential for success is correlated with their fealty to the maga movement and its leader. greene understood this before most; she was bending the knee well before trump even acknowledged her. and perhaps it s thanks to those political instincts that she now seems to be recognizing an opportunity to seize the narrative. with the government at a standstill, greene is once again making noise.related:it s not easy being (marjorie taylor) greene.why is marjorie taylor greene like this?

(trump, in turn, has called forboth leadersto be jailed.)it s the fifth such deployment in just 10 months of trump s second term in office, heightening concerns about creeping authoritarianism and politicization of the military. most of the deployments have been challenged in the courts.trump has claimed he s fighting a  war from within,  justifying the deployments with tenuous assertions of out-of-control crime and  rebellion. here s what you need to know.where it s happeninglos angeles:the largest city in california a state whose governor, gavin newsom, trump has repeatedly clashed with became the first u.s. city to see national guard and marine troops on its streets in june. they were sent in to quell protests against trump s immigration actions. a federal judge in september deemed those deploymentsillegal, a decision the trump administration has appealed.washington, d.c.:trump activated the national guard in the u.s. capital in august, claiming they were needed to address violent crime in the city despite data showing it to be at its lowest level in three decades. while the d.c. national guard is automatically under federal control, the troops there have seemingly spent more timemulching cherry trees and cleaning up garbagethan fighting crime. there s also an ongoinglegal challengeto this deployment.memphis, tennessee:this is the only deployment so far where the state s governor supports the move. republican gov. bill leesaidhe was  grateful  for trump s announcement of national guard troops in mid-september to  combat crime  in memphis. most of those troops arereportedlyyet to arrive, however, and are expected in the city on friday.portland, oregon:trump s decision to send troops to portland which he outlined in a sept. 27 truth socialpostdescribing the city as  war ravaged  was sparked by protests outside a local facility run by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice), the agency executing trump s aggressive deportation policy. a federal judge this weekblockedthat deployment, as well as trump s efforts to reassign national guard troops from other states such as california and texas to portland.chicago:as noted above, trump has deployed texas national guard troops to chicago. court hearings on the legality of that deployment as well as the one in portland took place on thursday.where else trump wants themtrump has mused about sending u.s. troops toseveralotherdemocratic-runcities, including his nativenew yorkas well assan francisco,baltimore, andnew orleans.the white house is also now weighing whether to invoke the insurrection act, which allows presidents greater control over the military to quell domestic rebellion. this would be a rare and extreme step, as the law has only been invoked30 times in 230 years. the last time was under president george h.w. bush during the 1992 los angeles riots.why it matterstrump s unprecedented and expanding effort to deploy troops in multiple u.s. cities is having rippling consequences and has the potential to set precedents that could impact generations to come. critics contend that trump is manufacturing crises and politicizing the military in dangerous ways that could undermine national security.retired military leaders haveexpressed serious concernsthat the deployments are hurting troop readiness, damaging the relationship between the military and public, and couldimpact recruitment.pollingshows that the administration s deployment of national guard troops in major u.s. cities is unpopular among voters. somerepublican lawmakersare also now beginning to express reservations over the deployments.let s get personnelas the u.s. federal government shutdown drags on into its second week, the trump administration is now threatening todeny back payto the roughly 750,000 federal workers who have been furloughed, in contravention of a law that trump himself signed during his first term in 2019. the uncertainty could further dent workforce morale and make the united states potentially vulnerable abroad, former state department spokesperson and cia analyst ned price told rishi last week. you can read more from price and others about the foreign-policy impact of the shutdownhere.separately, thewashington postreportsthat defense secretary pete hegseth s sweeping investigation into criticism of the recently slain right-wing activistcharlie kirkhas impacted some 300 defense department employees, even as the department forges ahead withcontroversial restrictionson the pentagon press corps.on the buttonwhat should be high on your radar, if it isn t already.gaza peace deal.trump announced in a truth socialposton wednesday that israel and hamas had agreed to the first phase of a deal to end the two-year war in gaza. under the deal, israel will withdraw its troops from parts of the territory to a stipulated line and release nearly 2,000 palestinian prisoners, while hamas will release the remaining 48 hostages it has in its custody, of whom 20 are believed to be alive. trumpsaidthe release is expected to take place  monday or tuesday,  and that he will  try and make a trip over  to the region in the coming days.while all parties appear to be on the same page for now, severalquestions and opportunities for the broader deal to fall apart remain,includingwhether hamas will agree to disarm, who will govern postwar gaza, and whether palestinian statehood will be on the table.war powers.the u.s. senate on wednesdayvoted downa bipartisan resolution aimed at curbing trump s ability to conduct military strikes on alleged venezuelan drug traffickers. democratic sen. john fetterman joined republicans in voting against the resolution, which was defeated 51-48, while republican sens. lisa murkowski and rand paul voted with democrats in favor of it.the trump administration has informed congress that the united states is in armed conflict with drug cartels in latin america, labeling the gangs as  narcoterrorists. snapshotbritish prime minister keir starmer and indian prime minister narendra modi hold a bilateral meeting at raj bhavan, the governor of maharashtra s official residence, in mumbai

adjusting the immune system s restraint so it hits hard against tumours without turning against the body.mary e brunkow, fred ramsdell and shimon sakaguchi are awarded this year's nobel prize in medicine or physiology. the nobel assembly at karolinska institutet announce the nobel prize in physiology or medicine on october 6, 2025, in stockholm, sweden. tt news agency/claudio bresciani via reutersthe immune system works like a highly trained security force, patrolling every corner of the body to detect and destroy bacteria, viruses and rogue cells. but even the best security team can be dangerous without oversight.left unchecked, immune cells can mistakenly attack healthy tissue: the hallmark of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis. and when the system becomes too cautious, it can overlook genuine threats, giving cancers the chance to grow unnoticed.for decades, scientists thought most of this immune  training  happened early in life, inside an organ called the thymus: a small gland above the heart where young immune cells learn which targets to attack and which to ignore. those that fail this test are eliminated before they can cause harm.but in the 1990s, japanese immunologist shimon sakaguchi discovered there was more to the story. through experiments on mice, he identified a previously unknown type of immune cell called a regulatory t cell: the peacekeepers of the immune system. these cells don t attack pathogens themselves.instead, they hold the rest of the immune army in check, preventing unnecessary destruction. when sakaguchi removed these cells in laboratory animals, their immune systems spiralled out of control, launching attacks on healthy organs. his work showed that these peacekeeping cells are essential for preventing the body from waging war on itself.a few years later, mary brunkow and fred ramsdell found the genetic switch that makes these peacekeepers possible. they discovered that a single mutation in a gene called foxp3 could leave both mice and human babies vulnerable to a rare but devastating autoimmune disorder called ipex syndrome. the foxp3 gene acts as the  on switch  for producing regulatory t cells. without it, the immune system loses its referees and chaos follows.related:commentary: don t overlook stage 0 cancer. it could be your earliest warning signcommentary: 'curing cancer' is a loaded termt helper and regulatory t cellsthe immune system relies on many types of t cells. t helper cells act as team captains, directing other immune cells to respond to infections. much of my own research has focused on how these cells behave in hiv infection, where their loss leaves the immune system defenceless. regulatory t cells belong to this same family but serve the opposite role: they calm things down when the fight goes too far.these peacekeepers keep the immune defenders focused on real threats rather than friendly targets. when they fail, autoimmune diseases emerge. but when they work too well, they can suppress immune attacks on cancer, allowing tumours to hide and grow. scientists are now learning how to fine-tune this balance: boosting the guards to control autoimmune disease, or easing the brakes so the body can fight back against cancer.these discoveries have redefined how doctors think about immunity. clinical trials are already testing therapies that expand regulatory t cells in people with arthritis, diabetes or after an organ transplant; helping the body to tolerate its own tissues.in cancer treatment, the opposite approach is used: blocking or disabling these peacekeepers to unleash a stronger immune attack on tumours. this is the principle behind modern immunotherapies, which have already transformed outcomes for patients with melanoma, lung cancer and lymphoma.related:commentary: a us brain drain doesn t benefit anyonecommentary: why clinical trials in singapore are a win-win for patients and the economybasic science can lead to profound changesthe work of brunkow, ramsdell and sakaguchi shows how basic science can lead to profound changes in medicine.their discoveries help explain not just why the immune system sometimes goes wrong, but how it can be guided back into balance   a balance that could one day prevent autoimmune diseases, improve transplant survival and make cancer therapies both safer and more effective.the nobel committee s decision this year recognises not only their scientific achievement, but also a vision of the immune system as something far more nuanced than an on-off switch. it s a finely tuned orchestra and regulatory t cells are its conductors, ensuring the right notes are played at the right time, silencing those that might cause chaos.by learning to adjust these biological  brakes  with precision, medicine is entering a new era. treatments inspired by these discoveries are already improving lives and may, in time, transform how we prevent and treat disease across the spectrum, from autoimmunity to cancer.justin stebbing is professor of biomedical sciences at anglia ruskin university. this commentaryfirst appearedon the conversation.source: others/chsign up for our newslettersget our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inboxsubscribe hereget the cna appstay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best storiesdownload hereget whatsapp alertsjoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat appjoin hererelated topicsnobel prizemedicinecancerimmune systemautoimmune diseaseadvertisementalso worth readingcontent is loading...advertisementexpand to read the full storyget bite-sized news via a newcards interface. give it a try.click here to return to fasttap here to return to fastfast"

sowing \"chaos\" with fresh strikes on ukraine's energy grid, while escalating drone attacks forced kyiv to begin new evacuations of children from frontline villages.zelenskyy, whose forces invaded ukraine in 2022, has escalated aerial attacks on ukrainian energy facilities and rail systems over recent weeks, spurring power outages and train delays.'30,000 in darkness': russia pounds ukraine with deadly strikes, cities engulfed in flames | watch\"russia's task is to create chaos and apply psychological pressure on the population through strikes on energy facilities and railways,\" zelenskyy told journalists, including afp, in comments released under embargo on thursday.he said later he was dispatching his prime minister and a senior sanctions advisor to the united states for talks early next week on air defence, energy, sanctions, as well as negotiations with russia and frozen russian assets.the recent attacks mirror similar russian bombing campaigns in the winters of 2022, 2023 and 2024 that left millions of ukrainians without energy or heating for long periods.his comments came just hours after fresh russian attacks damaged energy infrastructure in the southern black sea region of odesa, where port facilities were also struck.and they came just hours before the mayor of the frontline town of sloviansk called on residents to leave, citing russian attacks on energy and heating facilities.zelenskyy said that russian attacks this year had already put ukrainian gas infrastructure under \"heavy pressure\" and that more strikes could force his country to ramp up imports.children ordered to fleeukraine has also recently stepped up its own drone and missile strikes on russian territory in a campaign that zelenskyy said was showing \"results\" and that has also increased fuel prices in russia.\"we believe that they've lost up to 20 percent of their gasoline supply- directly as a result of our strikes,\" zelenskyy said, adding there was evidence russia had stepped up imports from china and belarus.russian forces meanwhile have been steadily pushing forward across the sprawling front line, forcing ukraine on thursday to announce the evacuation of children from parts of kramatorsk, a civilian hub and logistics centre in eastern ukraine.the town had a pre-war population of around 147,000 people and lies approximately 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the front line in the donetsk region, where the kremlin has concentrated its firepower.russia in late 2022 claimed to have annexed the industrial region alongside three others, despite not having full military control over them. kramatorsk's population has since dipped to around 50,000 people, officials have said.the authorities cited in their evacuation order an uptick in russian attacks with small, cheap first-person-view drones that have dramatically changed the character of fighting across the front line over recent months.the orders point to systemic problems facing the ukrainian army, which has been struggling to hold back a better-armed and larger army.the mayor of nearby sloviansk also on thursday urged residents to leave the city, as least for the colder winter months, since russia had stepped up attacks on heating facilities.\"especially elderly people and families with children- it is time to evacuate. at least for the period of the heating season. because we see that the enemy is targeting the energy system,\" vadym lyakh said in a post on social media.seven people were earlier wounded in strikes on the town, officials said.ukraine meanwhile recently struck a power station in the russian border region of belgorod, causing power outages.the ukrainian military said thursday it had also struck energy facilities, including a gas processing plant, in the

affidavits, how can we trust these? we are not in the business of conducting inquiry.\"\"we would have been with you had you given details of persons whose names have been deleted without intimation from the final voter list and whether their appeals have been disposed of without proper hearing.we could have intervened. why not a single instance cited by you? it seems there is too much passion and little reason,\" the bench told adr's counsel.however, the bench ensured that no name is deleted from the voters' list without following procedure and directed dlsa to deploy para-legal volunteers to inquire from booth level officers about the persons whose names figure in the deletion list of 3.75 lakh, which is in addition to 65 lakh, and facilitate them in filing an appeal against deletion.on ec's charge that the affidavit contained false information amounting to perjury, bhushan said, \"it was given to me by a responsible person. if ec is having a problem with it, the court can direct legal services authorities to inquire into it.\"justice bagchi said, \"ec has demonstrated that the facts are incorrect. if the person who has filed the affidavit is not found at the address given, how would legal services authority inquire into it.inquiry does not rectify falsehood.\" ec, through senior advocate rakesh dwivedi, said once the allegation is found to be false, the ngo would now change the narrative. \"their aim is to create a narrative through analysis based on wrong data,\" he said.social activist yogendra yadav took over from bhushan and alleged that the sir of bihar's electoral rolls has been weaponised to exclude a large chunk of voters, especially women.he said because of sir, around 80 lakh voters have been deleted from the list. based on data and graphics presented by him, the bench said till 2023, the number of voters in bihar exceeded the total adult population. when yadav said it was a problem which was cured subsequently, the bench said, \"if it (total number of voters ) was 105% of total adult population, it is a crisis not a problem.\"yadav said there are still several lakh voters with the same name and same address. ec should employ software to delete duplicate names from the final voter list, he said, which invited sarcastic comments from dwivedi, who said, \"till now they were seeking inclusion. now they want more exclusion.\" sc posted further hearing on thursday.end of articlefollow us on social mediavideospm modi speaks to  friend  trump, discusses trade, congratulates him on gaza peace planpm modi, keir

(2004) examined boron supplementation effects in laboratory settings, observing effects on growth factors associated with prostate tissue.research suggests boron may support healthy inflammation responses, cognitive function, and the body's natural detoxification processes.the mineral's mechanisms may include:supporting healthy hormone metabolismassisting vitamin d utilizationsupporting bone and joint healthcontributing to cognitive functionsupporting inflammatory response regulationtongkat ali: centuries of traditional use meet modern sciencetongkat ali (eurycoma longifolia) has been utilized in traditional southeast asian medicine for centuries, particularly in malaysia and indonesia, where it's been valued for supporting male vitality and wellness.prostavive includes this botanical based on multiple research studies examining its effects. research by talbott et al. (2013) examined tongkat ali's effects on stress hormones and psychological mood states in moderately stressed subjects. the study found that supplementation was associated with improvements in tension, anger, and confusion scores.additional research includes studies by george and henkel (2014) exploring tongkat ali's properties related to male health, and work by sikka (2001) examining oxidative stress impacts on male reproductive function.the scientific literature suggests multiple mechanisms through which this plant may support male health, including effects on stress response, antioxidant activity, and hormonal balance. the compound eurycomanone, isolated from tongkat ali, has been the subject of specific research attention for its potential bioactive properties.ashwagandha: the ancient adaptogenashwagandha (withania somnifera) is classified as an adaptogen a category of herbs believed to help the body adapt to various stressors. its use in traditional wellness systems dates back approximately 8,000 years.the charak samhita (circa 6000 bc), one of the foundational texts of ayurvedic medicine, documented ashwagandha's applications. modern research has examined various aspects of this botanical.studies include work by choudhary et al. (2015) examining ashwagandha's efficacy in improving cardiorespiratory endurance in healthy athletic adults, and research published in complementary therapies in medicine (2021) by gupta et al. examining effects in male subjects.contemporary research is revealing mechanisms that may explain ashwagandha's traditional applications, including effects on stress hormones, physical performance, and aspects of male reproductive health. the herb contains compounds called withanolides, which have been the subject of pharmacological research examining their potential biological activities.fenugreek: ancient medicinal herb with modern applicationsfenugreek (trigonella foenum-graecum) has been used in traditional medicine systems across mediterranean, middle eastern, and south asian cultures for millennia. archaeological evidence suggests its use dates back to ancient egypt.prostavive includes fenugreek based on research examining compounds called furostanol saponins found in fenugreek seeds. research by kamenov et al. (2017) published in maturitas evaluated efficacy and safety in male subjects through a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.additional research includes work by hozzein et al. (2020) published in food chemistry examining fenugreek's antioxidant properties and effects on various health parameters.fenugreek contains unique phytochemical compounds that have attracted significant research interest. the furostanol saponins appear to have multiple biological activities that may support various aspects of male health.panax ginseng: the revered rootpanax ginseng, discovered in the mountains of manchuria over 5,000 years ago, has been among the most researched botanicals in traditional chinese medicine. the formulation distinguishes panax ginseng from other ginseng varieties, noting that \"panax\" derives from the greek word \"panacea,\" reflecting its traditional regard.research includes work by leung and wong (2013) reviewing ginseng's relationship with male reproductive function, and studies by jung and jin (1996) examining physiological and biochemical effects of korean ginseng published in the korean journal of ginseng science.historical texts dating to the work of loewe and shaughnessy (1999) documenting ancient chinese medicine indicate ginseng has been systematically cultivated and utilized for at least five millennia.panax ginseng contains ginsenosides unique compounds that have been extensively studied for their potential effects on circulation, cognitive function, physical performance, and various aspects of metabolic health. the formulation uses authentic panax ginseng rather than less-researched ginseng varieties.maca root: the peruvian powerhousemaca (lepidium meyenii) is a cruciferous plant native to the high andes of peru, where it has been cultivated for approximately 2,000 years at elevations above 4,000 meters.multiple research studies on maca include work by tafuri et al. (2019) examining maca's role in male reproduction, research by quiroz and aliaga (1997) published by the international plant genetic resources institute, and a comprehensive 2024 review by ulloa del carpio et al. exploring maca's chemical and pharmacological variability.contemporary research has examined various aspects of maca, including effects on energy, mood, and parameters related to male reproductive health. the plant contains unique compounds called macaenes and macamides, which have been subjects of phytochemical research.artichoke extract: beyond culinary applicationswhile commonly known as a culinary vegetable, artichoke (cynara scolymus) has a long history of medicinal use in mediterranean traditional medicine. the formulation includes artichoke extract based on research examining its bioactive compounds.studies include research by englisch et al. (2000) examining artichoke extract efficacy in patients with certain health parameters, and work by thomas-charles et al. (2019) published in molecular biology reports reviewing plant-derived bioactive compounds.artichoke contains powerful antioxidant compounds, particularly cynarin and silymarin. research suggests these compounds may support cardiovascular health, which is intrinsically connected to overall blood flow and circulation.nettle root: traditional european botanicalnettle root (urtica dioica) has been used in european traditional medicine for centuries, particularly for supporting urinary and prostate health in men.research by ghorbanibirgani et al. (2013) was published as a randomized double-blind study examining nettle's efficacy in 100 patients with benign prostatic concerns, and work by chrubasik et al. (2007) provided a comprehensive review on nettle root effects and efficacy profiles.additional research includes work by shonte and de kock (2017) published in the south african journal of botany examining nettle's bioactive properties. nettle root has been specifically studied for urinary tract health and has shown promise in multiple clinical trials, with its traditional use substantially validated through contemporary research methodologies.essential minerals: the foundational supportprostavive includes three essential minerals with specific relevance to male health:zinc: extensive research on zinc's role in male health includes work by fallah et al. (2018) titled \"zinc is an essential element for male fertility\" which reviewed zinc's roles in male health, cellular function, and reproductive parameters. additional research by mocchegiani et al. (2013) examined zinc supplementation effects on immune function.zinc is involved in hundreds of enzymatic processes, plays essential roles in immune function, and is concentrated in high levels in prostate tissue.magnesium: research includes work by gr ber et al. (2015) examining magnesium in prevention and therapy. magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body and plays roles in energy production, muscle function, nervous system regulation, and cardiovascular health.vitamin d: research by murphy et al. (2016) examined vitamin d's correlation with prostate volume in men undergoing certain procedures, work by farag et al. (2016) published using national health and nutrition examination survey data, and research by canguven et al. (2020) reviewing vitamin d's relationship with male health parameters.research increasingly suggests that adequate vitamin d status may be important for numerous aspects of male health, including prostate wellness.manufacturing excellence: quality control standardsprostavive is manufactured in facilities that adhere to stringent quality standards designed to ensure product safety, purity, and consistency.fda registration and oversightthe manufacturing facility is registered with the u.s. food and drug administration (fda). while dietary supplements do not require fda approval before marketing unlike pharmaceutical drugs fda-registered facilities are subject to inspection and must comply with specific regulatory requirements.fda registration provides accountability through facility inspections that can occur without notice, with requirements to maintain detailed records of manufacturing processes, ingredient sourcing, testing protocols, and quality control measures.read about prostavive s quality standards and testing protocolsgood manufacturing practices (gmp) compliancethe facility follows current good manufacturing practices (cgmp) as outlined in 21 cfr part 111 the fda's quality system regulation for dietary supplements.gmp compliance requires:identity testing: verification that ingredients are what they claim to bepurity testing: screening for contaminants

absence of harmful agricultural chemicalsevery batch is thoroughly tested before reaching consumers, with this multi-stage testing approach providing multiple verification points throughout the manufacturing process.the prostate health challenge: understanding the problemthe announcement comes amid growing awareness of prostate health challenges affecting millions of men worldwide.prevalence and impactaccording to published epidemiological data, prostate-related concerns are extremely common as men age. the national institutes of health estimates that by age 60, more than half of men experience some degree of prostate-related urinary symptoms, with that figure rising to approximately 90% by age 85.these concerns can significantly impact quality of life through:frequent urination, particularly at night (nocturia)weak or interrupted urinary streamdifficulty starting or stopping urinationfeeling of incomplete bladder emptyingurgency (sudden need to urinate)impact on sleep qualityeffects on daily activities and travelpsychological and emotional effectsimpact on intimate relationshipsthe data indicates that prostate-related concerns are not a question of \"if\" but \"when\" for most men, underscoring the importance of proactive approaches to maintaining prostate health throughout the aging process.the conventional approachtraditional management of prostate concerns has typically focused on:watchful waiting and lifestyle modifications for mild symptomspharmaceutical interventions for moderate symptomssurgical procedures for severe casesregular monitoring through prostate-specific antigen (psa) testing and physical examinationthese approaches have their place in medical care. however, there's growing interest in preventive strategies that may help maintain prostate health before significant concerns develop.the natural supplement alternativethe dietary supplement market for prostate health has grown substantially, with consumers spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually on prostate-supporting products.men are increasingly seeking natural options that can complement their health routines, with demand for evidence-based formulations featuring transparent ingredient sourcing and clear scientific rationale.common ingredients found in prostate supplements include saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, pygeum, and pumpkin seed extract. prostavive distinguishes itself through its focus on blood flow optimization rather than these more conventional ingredient choices.learn more about prostavive s research-based approach to men s healthresearch-based expectations: what published studies suggestpublished research on prostavive's individual ingredients provides insight into potential mechanisms and areas of support, though individual responses to any supplement vary significantly based on numerous factors.timeline considerations based on researchresearch on botanical supplements generally indicates that the timeframe for observing effects varies considerably among study participants.factors identified in scientific literature that influence response include:age and overall health statusbaseline severity of concernslifestyle factors (diet, exercise, stress levels)concurrent medications or supplementsindividual biochemistry and metabolismconsistency of supplement useclinical studies on ingredients similar to those in prostavive typically employ study periods ranging from 8 to 24 weeks, with some longer-term studies extending to 6 months or beyond. this research timeline informed the manufacturer's recommendation for consistent daily use of at least 90 to 180 days.this recommendation aligns with the product's 180-day satisfaction policy, providing customers with six months to evaluate effects a timeframe consistent with research study durations.areas examined in published researchbased on published research examining the ingredients in prostavive, scientific literature has investigated potential effects in several areas:urinary function parameters: research on ingredients like nettle root and zinc has examined metrics including:urine flow rate measurementsfrequency of urination episodesnocturia (nighttime urination) incidentspost-void residual volumeinternational prostate symptom score (ipss) changesenergy and physical performance: studies on adaptogens including ashwagandha and panax ginseng have investigated:endurance capacity measurementsphysical stamina assessmentscognitive performance testingsubjective vitality scoresexercise performance metricssleep quality

indicesquality of life related to sexual healthoverall wellness markers: research has examined various physiological and biochemical markers including:inflammatory response markersoxidative stress indicatorscardiovascular health parametersmetabolic health measurementsquality of life assessmentsimportant scientific note:these represent areas examined in published research on individual ingredients. they do not constitute claims about prostavive's effects, as the complete formula has not undergone clinical trials. individual experiences vary significantly, and prostavive is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.research-supported lifestyle integrationscientific literature consistently emphasizes that dietary supplementation produces optimal results when combined with comprehensive health practices:dietary factors supported by research:adequate hydration supporting urinary functionbalanced nutrition providing essential micronutrientsinclusion of foods studied for prostate support (lycopene-rich tomatoes, omega-3 fatty fish, polyphenol-rich berries, selenium-rich nuts)limitation of pro-inflammatory dietary patternsmoderate caffeine intake, particularly in evening hoursphysical activity based on clinical evidence:regular aerobic exercise (150 minutes weekly of moderate activity per cdc guidelines)resistance training for maintaining muscle mass and metabolic healthpelvic floor exercises examined in urological researchflexibility and mobility work supporting overall functionconsistent physical activity patternsstress management supported by research:adequate sleep duration (7-9 hours as recommended by sleep research)evidence-based stress reduction techniques (meditation, controlled breathing, mindfulness practices)social connection supporting psychological wellbeingengagement in recreational activitieswork-life balance strategiesmedical care recommendations:regular healthcare provider consultationsage-appropriate prostate screening following medical guidelinesopen communication with healthcare teammanagement of comorbid health conditionsadherence to prescribed medicationsresearch consistently demonstrates that supplements function most effectively as components of comprehensive health strategies rather than replacements for healthy lifestyle practices or appropriate medical care.safety profile and considerationsprostavive is formulated with natural ingredients generally recognized as safe. however, comprehensive safety information is provided for consumers.general tolerabilityaccording to available information, prostavive is formulated to be generally well-tolerated. the powder format may offer advantages for individuals who have difficulty swallowing capsules or tablets.the formula is free from:common allergens (gluten, dairy, soy, wheat)animal products (suitable for vegetarian and vegan consumers)artificial colors, flavors, or preservativesstimulants like caffeinehabit-forming substancesconsultation recommendationsmedical consultation before beginning supplementation is strongly recommended for individuals who:have existing medical conditions:diagnosed prostate conditionscardiovascular diseasediabetes or blood sugar disorderskidney or liver diseasehormonal disordersblood pressure concernsany chronic health conditiontake medications:blood pressure medicationsblood thinners or anticoagulantsdiabetes medicationshormone therapiesmedications for prostate conditionsany prescription medicationshave special circumstances:scheduled for surgery (discontinuation 2 weeks prior recommended)undergoing medical treatmentin active treatment for any health conditionhistory of adverse reactions to supplementsage restrictions:prostavive is formulated for adult men aged 18 and oldernot intended for use by womennot recommended for adolescentseven natural ingredients can interact with medications or medical conditions. healthcare providers can assess individual risk factors and provide personalized guidance based on complete medical history and current health status.potential interactions based on ingredient researchwhile comprehensive interaction studies have not been conducted on the complete prostavive formula,published research on individual ingredients suggests potential interactions to be aware of:blood glucose considerations: research on ingredients including fenugreek and panax ginseng has examined effects on blood glucose metabolism. individuals with diabetes or taking diabetes medications should monitor blood sugar levels and consult their healthcare provider regarding potential interactions.blood pressure considerations: studies on certain botanicals have investigated cardiovascular effects. individuals with hypertension or taking blood pressure medications should consult their healthcare provider before supplementation.hormonal considerations: several ingredients have been subjects of research examining hormonal parameters. individuals with hormone-sensitive conditions or taking hormone therapies should discuss supplementation with their healthcare provider.anticoagulation considerations: research on some botanical ingredients has identified compounds with potential anticoagulant properties. individuals taking blood thinners like warfarin should consult their healthcare provider and may require more frequent monitoring.these represent circumstances requiring medical guidance rather than absolute contraindications. many individuals in these categories can safely use supplements with appropriate medical supervision and monitoring.see published research referenced in the prostavive formulationmarket trends and consumer demandthe announcement reflects broader trends in the men's health supplement market supported by market research data.growing proactive health movementmarket research indicates increasing consumer interest in preventive health measures. rather than waiting for health concerns to develop, demographic data shows more men are seeking proactive strategies to maintain wellness as they age.a fundamental mindset shift is occurring, with men moving from reactive symptom management to proactive health optimization. consumer surveys indicate growing interest in preventive strategies and early intervention approaches.this trend aligns with similar patterns in other health categories including cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and metabolic wellness, reflecting broader cultural shifts toward preventive medicine.transparency and evidence expectationsmarket research on consumer behavior, particularly among middle-aged and older demographics, reveals increasingly sophisticated evaluation of supplement claims.consumer surveys indicate expectations for:complete ingredient disclosurescientific references and research citationstransparent manufacturing standardsthird-party quality verification where possiblehonest communication about expected outcomesabsence of exaggerated or misleading claimsconsumer behavior studies demonstrate that modern supplement purchasers conduct research, consult with healthcare providers, and make informed decisions. market data suggests that companies providing transparent, science-based information earn higher consumer trust ratings.natural product preferencewhile pharmaceutical options for prostate health exist, consumer preference surveys indicate significant interest in natural approaches when appropriate.market research identifies this preference as driven by:desire to avoid potential medication side effectsinterest in holistic health approachespreference for preventive rather than reactive strategiescomfort with traditional botanical medicine supported by modern researchdesire for options suitable for long-term usemarket analysis indicates that \"natural\" positioning resonates with consumers when accompanied by rigorous scientific investigation of botanical ingredients, combining traditional knowledge with contemporary research methodologies.direct-to-consumer modelprostavive's exclusive availability through the company website reflects growing consumer comfort with direct-to-consumer supplement purchasing documented in e-commerce trend analyses.market research identifies several advantages of this model:direct communication channels between company and customerenhanced quality control through elimination of intermediary handlingability to provide comprehensive product informationenhanced customer service and support capabilitiesprice efficiency through elimination of retail markupconsumer behavior data indicates increasing acceptance of online supplement purchasing, particularly when companies provide robust information, quality assurances, and responsive customer service.clinical perspective: healthcare provider attitudeswhile specific surveys of healthcare providers regarding prostavive have not been conducted, published literature on healthcare provider attitudes toward natural supplements provides relevant context.integrative medicine approachpublished surveys of healthcare providers indicate that many, particularly those practicing integrative or functional medicine, are open to evidence-based natural supplements as components of comprehensive health strategies.medical literature increasingly documents healthcare provider interest in natural approaches supported by peer-reviewed research, recognizing that conventional medicine and evidence-based natural products can function complementarily.the manufacturer encourages customers to share complete ingredient information and research citations with their healthcare providers to facilitate informed discussion and collaborative decision-making.the role of supplementation in medical practicepublished medical literature consistently emphasizes that supplements should complement rather than replace fundamental health practices and appropriate medical care. this evidence-based perspective aligns with prostavive's positioning.medical consensus indicates that no supplement can overcome poor lifestyle habits or substitute for necessary medical care. prostavive is positioned as one component of a comprehensive approach to male health and wellness rather than a standalone intervention.educational resources and customer supportthe manufacturer provides extensive educational resources to help customers make informed decisions and optimize their experience with prostavive.comprehensive product informationthe company website includes:complete

development: future directionswhile prostavive's current formulation is based on existing published research, the manufacturer indicates ongoing attention to the evolving science of prostate health and male wellness.emerging research areasseveral areas of ongoing scientific investigation are relevant to prostate health and may inform future product development:microbiome connections: emerging research published in recent years is examining potential relationships between gut microbiome composition and prostate health. studies suggest that certain probiotic strains may influence immune function and inflammation patterns with potential relevance to prostate wellness.metabolic health links: published research increasingly documents connections between metabolic health parameters (including blood sugar regulation and insulin sensitivity) and prostate concerns. understanding these connections through ongoing research may inform future approaches to comprehensive male health support.inflammation and oxidative stress: chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress are recognized in scientific literature as factors in numerous age-related health concerns. ongoing research continues to examine how various natural compounds might support healthy inflammatory responses and antioxidant status.cellular senescence: the accumulation of senescent cells (cells that have stopped dividing but remain metabolically active) represents an emerging area of aging research. natural compounds are being studied for potential effects on cellular senescence, with implications for tissue health throughout the body.scientific advancement is continuous, with ongoing attention to emerging research that might inform future product development or refinement of existing formulations based on new scientific evidence.commitment to evidence-based formulationany future formulation changes would be based on published scientific evidence rather than marketing trends or unsubstantiated claims.the supplement industry faces credibility challenges due to products making exaggerated claims without scientific backing. the commitment to maintaining high evidentiary standards means every ingredient in prostavive is included because peer-reviewed research suggests potential benefits, not because of marketing considerations.regulatory compliance and ethical standardsas a dietary supplement, prostavive is subject to regulatory oversight by the u.s. food and drug administration under the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994 (dshea).dshea frameworkunder dshea, dietary supplements are regulated differently than pharmaceutical drugs.key provisions include:supplements do not require fda approval before marketing (unlike drugs)manufacturers are responsible for ensuring safety before marketingsupplement labels may make structure/function claims but not disease claimssupplements must carry a disclaimer stating they are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent diseasemanufacturers must notify fda of any serious adverse eventsfda can take action against unsafe supplements or false/misleading claimsregulatory obligations are taken seriously, with compliance representing not just regulatory requirement avoidance but maintenance of consumer trust and ethical operation.labeling accuracyprostavive labeling includes:complete ingredient disclosure (supplement facts panel)appropriate structure/function claims with required disclaimermanufacturer information and contact detailsdirections for usewarnings and precautionsallergen informationmanufacturing facility informationaccurate, complete labeling is fundamental to informed consumer choice and regulatory compliance.advertising and marketing standardsmarketing practices are designed to comply with federal trade commission (ftc) guidelines for supplement advertising,which require:truthful, non-deceptive claimssubstantiation for claims through competent and reliable scientific evidenceclear disclosure of limitationsappropriate disclaimersavoidance of false or misleading representationslong-term reputation and consumer trust are prioritized over short-term gains from exaggerated claims.environmental and sustainability considerationswhile not a primary focus of the product announcement, attention to environmental and sustainability factors in operations is noted.ingredient sourcingthe manufacturer reports working with suppliers who can demonstrate responsible sourcing practices,including:sustainable harvesting of botanicalssupport for biodiversity conservationfair labor practicesminimization of environmental impactdocumentation of supply chain traceabilitymany of the botanicals have been harvested in their native regions for centuries. commercial harvesting conducted sustainably with benefits to local communities is emphasized.packaging considerationsprostavive packaging is designed to protect product quality while minimizing unnecessary material use. recyclable materials are used where feasible, with ongoing exploration of opportunities to reduce packaging environmental impact.access customer information and educational resources at prostavive.orgconsumer education: making informed decisionsconsumer education in making appropriate decisions about prostate health supplementation is emphasized.evaluation questions for consumersconsumers are encouraged to consider several questions when evaluating any prostate supplement:about ingredients:are all ingredients clearly disclosed with amounts?is there published research supporting the included ingredients?are the ingredient amounts consistent with research dosages?are the botanicals properly identified (species, plant parts)?are there any proprietary blends that hide individual amounts?about quality:where is the product manufactured?what quality standards does the manufacturer follow?is the facility fda-registered and gmp-compliant?what testing is performed on ingredients and finished products?can the company provide certificates of analysis?about the company:how long has the company been in business?what is the company's reputation?how responsive is customer service?what is the return/refund policy?are contact information and physical address provided?about claims:are claims supported by scientific evidence?does the company make unrealistic promises?are appropriate disclaimers included?is the product presented honestly and transparently?educated consumers are empowered to make decisions aligned with their individual needs and values.when to seek medical attentioncertain symptoms require prompt medical evaluation rather than self-treatment with supplements:urgent symptoms:complete inability to urinateblood in urine or semensevere pain in lower abdomen, back, or genitalsfever accompanying urinary symptomssudden onset of severe symptomssymptoms requiring evaluation:progressive worsening of urinary symptomssymptoms that significantly impact quality of lifenew or unexplained symptomssymptoms not improving with conservative measuressupplements are for health maintenance and support, not for treating serious medical conditions. anyone with concerning symptoms should seek healthcare provider evaluation for proper diagnosis and treatment.looking forward: the future of male healththe announcement comes at a time of increasing attention to men's health issues broadly, with growing recognition that men have historically been underserved in preventive health initiatives.shifting cultural attitudescultural shifts in men's willingness to prioritize health are documented in public health literature. traditional masculinity norms that discouraged health-seeking behavior are breaking down, with men increasingly proactive about maintaining health and quality of life.this shift is reflected in public health data showing growing participation in preventive health screenings, increased use of primary care services, and rising interest in wellness practices including nutrition, exercise, stress management, and appropriate supplementation.personalized approachesthe future of health and wellness increasingly emphasizes personalization recognizing that individuals have unique genetic backgrounds, health statuses, lifestyle factors, and needs.while prostavive is formulated based on research applicable to broad populations, individual response variation is recognized. the future likely includes more personalized approaches based on genetic profiles, biomarkers, and individual health data as personalized medicine advances.integration of traditional and modernprostavive exemplifies a trend toward integrating traditional botanical knowledge with modern scientific research methodologies honoring centuries or millennia of traditional use while subjecting these botanicals to rigorous scientific investigation.traditional medicine systems worldwide have accumulated vast knowledge about plants and their effects. modern science helps understand mechanisms, optimize dosing, ensure safety, and validate traditional uses through controlled research. this integration represents synthesis of traditional wisdom and contemporary scientific rigor.conclusion: research-based prostate health supportthe expanded availability of prostavive represents an approach to prostate health support that addresses underlying physiological factors through blood flow optimization while respecting both traditional botanical wisdom and contemporary scientific rigor.prostate health challenges affect most men eventually. access to evidence-based natural options that can be part of comprehensive health strategies is important for men seeking to maintain wellness as they age.prostavive represents a commitment to providing such an option formulated based on published science, manufactured to high standards, and supported by education and responsive customer service.prostavive is not positioned as a replacement for medical care, pharmaceutical interventions when necessary, or fundamental health practices. rather, it's intended as one component of a holistic approach to male health and wellness throughout the aging process.for men seeking natural approaches to prostate health support, prostavive offers a research-based option backed by published scientific literature, manufactured to quality standards, and supported by comprehensive customer service.about prostaviveprostaviveis a dietary supplement formulated to support prostate health

(ap photo/evan vucci)worldtrump sees peace   and personal vindication   within reach in gazaoct. 1006:05 am jstoct. 10 | 11:30 am jst50commentsby chris megerianwashingtonever since donald trump returned to office, his attempts to make a name for himself as a historic peacemaker have been frustrated by the ceaseless russian invasion of ukraine and the persistent fighting between israel and hamas in gaza.now trump is on the brink of a remarkable breakthrough in one of those conflicts. he's forged a deal that could end the middle east bloodshed that began just over two years ago with hamas' deadly attack on israel and cost the lives of tens of thousands of palestinians.if the pieces continue to fall into place   and that's far from certain in this combustible corner of the world   it would be a moment of vindication for a president derided by critics as a diplomatic bumbler more interested in personal prestige than international harmony.trump basked in his achievement on thursday at a meeting with his cabinet officials, saying it's  something that people said was never going to be done  and claiming the agreement could lead to an  everlasting peace.  everything came together,  said trump, who has long promoted himself as a master dealmaker dating back to his days as a new york real estate mogul.the president plans to solidify the deal with a hastily planned trip to the middle east over the weekend. he said he could participate in some kind of signing ceremony in egypt, which has been a key player in negotiations, and speak to the knesset in israel.as difficult as it was to reach this point, advancing the fragile effort to end the war will continue to test trump's patience and focus. israeli lawmakers still have to formally approve the plan. then hamas must release hostages that it kidnapped in its initial assault, while israel has promised to turn over palestinian prisoners. more challenges remain over providing humanitarian assistance in gaza and assembling a transitional government there.there's also no guarantee that the ceasefire becomes a turning point for the region, which is accustomed to brief interludes between fighting rather than durable coexistence. it is not a peace agreement,  said aaron david miller, who served as an adviser on middle east issues to democratic and republican administrations over two decades.  it is not a guaranteed end to the war. however, he described the plan as a significant achievement and said,  something has happened here that breaks a two-year conflict and offers an alternative pathway. by happenstance, the nobel peace prize is scheduled to be announced on friday. trump has explicitly campaigned for the honor, although he s not expected to win.only three sitting u.s. presidents have received the nobel peace prize   a fourth, jimmy carter, was recognized for his post-presidential work   and trump would be an unusual choice in some ways. he's scoffed at multilateral institutions, bragged about bombing iranian nuclear sites and pushed the limits of presidential power by striking alleged drug trafficking operations connected to venezuela.trump appears to be girding himself for disappointment. whatever they do is fine,  he told reporters.  i know this: i didn t do it for that, i did it because i saved a lot of lives. vice president jd vance appealed to trump's sense of grievance during thursday's cabinet meeting. for months, the fake news media attacked you, attacked the entire team, attacked your approach,  he said. vance said,  the reason we re here is because the president charted a different course. trump had no experience in foreign policy before his first term as president, and he's been less willing than ever to heed the advice of experts in his second. his point person on negotiations was steve witkoff, a friend and fellow real estate developer, with an assist from jared kushner, the president's son-in-law.secretary of state marco rubio credited trump's trip to the middle east earlier this year, when he went to saudi arabia, qatar and the united arab emirates, as well as conversations during the recent united nations general assembly.another key moment came during israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu's visit to the white house two weeks ago. trump prodded him to apologize for israel's airstrike on hamas leaders in qatar, a u.s. ally in the region that had been hosting ceasefire negotiations.then, trump announced his plan to end the war in gaza and gave hamas a deadline to accept it. although hamas responded conditionally, trump pushed forward anyway.on thursday afternoon, trump welcomed finnish president alexander stubb to the oval office to finalize a deal on icebreaker ships that are crucial for operations in the arctic.stubb is one of trump's preferred european interlocutors, and he lavished praise on the gaza agreement by saying,  this is what diplomacy is at its best. foreign leaders widely acknowledged trump s role and expressed relief at the possibility of ending the war in gaza, but they were also much more cautious after watching previous attempts unravel.u.n. secretary-general ant nio guterres issued a boilerplate statement, saying,  i welcome the announcement of an agreement to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages in gaza, based on the proposal put forward by president donald trump. french president emanuel macron praised trump s work on the deal and urged  all parties to strictly uphold its terms. turkish president tayyip erdogan, who recently visited the white house, expressed his  sincere gratitude to u.s. president donald trump, who demonstrated the necessary political will to encourage the israeli government toward the ceasefire. german chancellor friedrich merz only referenced  the american president  and noted that  this is not really concluded. at thursday's cabinet meeting, trump reiterated his claim that he's already  settled seven wars or major conflicts  since taking office, making the war in gaza  number eight. and what about russia and ukraine? i think that's going to happen too,  he insisted.associated press writer laurie kellman

    "text": "analysishamas is trusting trump as his 'eternal peace' in gaza turns into a shaky ceasefireby middle east correspondenteric tlozektopic:unrest, conflict and warthu 9 octthursday 9 octoberthu 9 oct 2025 at 9:30pmdonald trump says israel and hamas have agreed on the first phase of a gaza ceasefire.(reuters: evelyn hockstein)this is not a peace plan   it's a temporary ceasefire.the bombing will hopefully stop and, three days later, israeli hostages will be handed to the red cross and taken out of gaza, ending 738 days in captivity.aid is supposed to surge into the strip, finally allowing palestinians more food, clean water, medicine and shelter.the israeli military will withdraw outside gaza's ruined cities, not outside the strip, nor to its borders.this is being described as \"phase one\" of a deal that was supposed to be comprehensive.given no-one is really sticking to the proposed\"20-point plan\", the deal is far less detailed than the january ceasefire, which the us puzzlingly allowed israel to abandon after the first phase, with many hostages still in gaza.after claiming credit for that agreement, us president donald trump then appeared to lose interest and his administration subsequently allowed israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to turn down or alter new ceasefire proposals, after hamas had accepted them.now, the key differences are that this deal will leave no hostages in gaza and that trump has belatedly demonstrated he is willing to lean hard on mr netanyahu.mr netanyahu's hubris may have caused this.after israel smashed longtime foes iran and hezbollah, the decision to strike hamas negotiators in qatar was a clear case of overreach, a miscalculation that ended america's forbearance.israel's failed assassination attempt in doha shocked the middle east and sparked strident protests to the white house from allies like qatar, the united arab emirates, jordan, t rkiye, egypt and saudi arabia.when the us realised the extent of the damage, mr trump finally got tough with mr netanyahu, forcing him to apologise to the qatari government (ensuring the apology was highly publicised) and promise not to attack again.hamas says the us has now guaranteed that this is the end of the war.the militant group accepted the deal after white house peace envoy steve witkoff and mr trump's son-in-law jared kushner, both of whom had strong business links to qatar, arrived at the negotiations and provided assurances the us would enforce conditions on israel.they then flew to israel and attended a cabinet meeting, an extraordinary step to no doubt emphasise that this was a done deal.after all, mr trump promised the plan would bring \"eternal peace\" to the region.steve witkoff (left) and jared kushner (right) have attended israel's cabinet meeting with benjamin netanyahu.(supplied)hamas is trusting mr trump to keep the peace, a major gamble if he is not awarded the nobel peace prize and loses interest again.the militant group is also accepting the deal without major concessions from israel.high-profile prisoners like popular political leadermarwan barghoutiwill remain in israeli custody, as will the bodies of hamas leaders yahya and mohammad sinwar.israel is not withdrawing fully from gaza, as hamas has always demanded.the group, under blockade and pressure from its remaining allies, will have few options to rebuild.with the hostages back home, israel's government should have less of a justification to resume its onslaught and even less support from an exhausted and traumatised public.some unpopular elements of the 20-point plan seem to have been quietly sidelined, such as the proposed leadership of former british prime minister tony blair and the strange, investor-friendly, techno-centric gaza of the future that his foundation envisioned.the ceasefire seems to have been accepted on the basis that everything else   future governance of gaza, security, palestinian self-determination   can be worked out later.that means all the elements that led to this conflict remain, with palestinians in both the west bank and gaza now living in far worse conditions than before.hamas's only victory out of this devastation was to put the fate of palestinians at the centre of the world's consciousness.after the ceasefire, if there is no meaningful political settlement between israel and palestine and palestinian self-determination is blocked, people will be left with even more reasons to feel hopeless.stopping the bombs and starvation is a vital step, but it's just the first, and if the world, particularly the us, looks away, things could easily go backwards.loading"

planproposed by u.s. president donald trump. if it holds, the agreement will be a major breakthrough in ending the war, which has claimed more than 65,000 palestinian lives since hamas killed roughly 1,200 people and captured 251 hostages in an attack on israel on oct. 7, 2023.as the deal stands, hamas said it will release all remaining hostages, including the roughly20 who are believed to be aliveand the bodies of around 25 others. israel, meanwhile,will release1,700 gazans detained during the war and an additional 250 palestinians serving life sentences in israel. israel will alsopartially withdrawfrom gaza and allow a surge of medical aid and food trucks into the enclave.this is the third cease-fire reached in the war; most recently, 25 israeli hostages were exchanged for almost 2,000 prisoners earlier this year before israel ended the cease-fire in a surprise attack in march.at acabinet meetingon thursday, trump announced his plans to travel to egypt for an  official signing  of the deal in the near future. and in a phone call with trump on thursday, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahuinvitedthe u.s. president to address the knesset during the latter s expected visit to israel on sunday.but the intricacies of the deal and just how much of trump s plan has been accepted are unclear. both sides are on track to concede their most aspirational demands: hamas haslong refusedto release hostages unless arrangements for a permanent cease-fire are made, while israel has repeatedly refused deals that don t involve hamas s disarmament. other sticking points, such as the palestinian authority s role in postwar gaza and the potential for a two-state solution, were onlyvaguely detailedin trump s plan and have not yet been agreed upon by the parties. the current deal is a major accomplishment and an important step forward for both gaza and israel making it last will prove even harder,  daniel byman wrote inforeign policy. the international pressure from europe, the united states, and the arab world that forced negotiations will likely continue. but israel and hamas might themselves compromise a lasting cease-fire by refusing to adhere to conditions of the deal, dragging their feet, or resuming fighting outright.israel s government is expected to convene on thursday tovoteon the deal. if it is approved, the cease-fire will go into effect immediately. the hostage and prisoner exchange will take place soon after likely monday or tuesday, according to trump.though the agreement is tentative, hundreds gathered in tel aviv s  hostages square  to celebrate the announcement. in gaza, celebrations spilled into the streets amid flattened buildings, rubble, and the memory of tens of thousands killed. we don t know whether to feel happy or sad,  one woman displaced from khan younis, a city in the southern gaza strip, toldthe associated press.  a whole generation was lost. two generations were lost, not just one. may god

within south sudan s military and government. in september, kiir s governmentchargedformer rebel leader riek machar with murder, treason, and crimes against humanity for his alleged involvement in anattackthat killed 28 people in march. machar was also stripped of the vice presidency, which he assumed in 2020 as part of a post-civil war power-sharing agreement.analysts saythese shake-ups may be a bid by kiir to consolidate control ahead oflong-postponed elections, now expected to be held in 2026. kiir has led the transitional government since south sudan gained independence from sudan in 2011 and throughout the country s nearly five-yearcivil war.apostolic exhortation.pope leo released his first major papal document, titled  i have loved you,  on thursday, calling on christians to

praisesthe church s traditionof welcoming strangers and especially credits women for their work providing health care to the poor. leo, whose criticism of the trump administration has beenramping up, alsoseemed to referencetrump s immigration policies:  where the world sees threats, she [the catholic church] sees children; where walls are built, she builds bridges. leo criticized  political-economic systems that favor the strongest  for creating extreme wealth inequality and a culture that  tolerates with indifference that millions of people die of hunger or survive in conditions unfit for human beings.  he called for a global commitment to addressing the root causes of poverty while giving charity to those who suffer in the meantime.  a church that sets no limits to love, that knows no enemies to fight but only men and women to love, is the church that the world needs today,  leo wrote.odds and endsthenobel prize in literaturewas awarded to hungarian novelist

trump's relationships helped pull off a gaza dealat the time, israel's air strike against the hamas negotiating team in qatar seemed like yet another escalation that pushed the prospect of peace further away.the attack on 9 september violated the sovereignty of an american ally and risked expanding the conflict into a region-wide war.diplomacy appeared to be in ruins.instead it turned out to be a key moment that has led to a deal, announced by president donald trump, to release all remaining hostages.this is a goal that he, and president joe biden before him, had sought for nearly two years.it is just the first step towards a more durable peace, and the details of hamas disarmament, gaza governance and full israeli withdrawal remain to be negotiated.but if this agreement holds, it could be trump's signature achievement of his second term - one that eluded biden and his diplomatic team.trump's unique style and crucial relationships with israel and the arab world appear to have contributed to this breakthrough.but, as with most diplomatic achievements, there were also factors at play beyond control of either man.getty imagesshoulder to shoulder - trump and netanyahua close relationship that biden never hadin public, trump and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu are all smiles.trump likes to say that israel has no better friend, and netanyahu has described trump as israel's \"greatest ever ally in the white house\". and these warm words have been matched by actions.during his first presidential term, trump moved the us embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem and abandoned a long-held us position that israeli settlements in the palestinian west bank are illegal, the position under international law.when israel began its air strikes against iran in june, trump ordered us bombers to target the nation's nuclear enrichment facilities with its most powerful conventional bombs.those public demonstrations of support may have given trump the room to exert more pressure on israel behind the scenes. according to reports, trump's negotiator, steve witkoff, browbeat netanyahu in late 2024 into accepting a temporary ceasefire in exchange for the release of some hostages.when israel launched strikes against syrian forces in july, trump pressured netanyahu to change course.trump exhibited a degree of will and pressure on an israeli prime minister that is virtually unprecedented, says aaron david miller of the carnegie endowment for international peace. \"there is no example of an american president literally telling an israeli prime minister that you're going to have to comply or else.\"reutersisraelis wave national and us flags after news of the agreementlive: israel approves trump's gaza agreementanalysis: gaza deal is huge moment but just the startbiden's relationship with netanyahu's government was always more tenuous.his administration's \"bear hug\" strategy held that the us had to embrace israel publicly in order to allow it to moderate the nation's war conduct in private.underneath this was biden's nearly half-century of support for israel, as well as sharp divisions within his democratic coalition over the gaza war. every step biden took risked fracturing his own domestic support, whereas trump's solid republican base gave him more room to manoeuvre.in the end, domestic politics or personal relationships may have had less importance than the simple fact that, during biden's presidency, israel was not ready to make peace.eight months into trump's second term, with iran chastened, hezbollah to its immediate north greatly diminished and gaza in ruins, all its major strategy objectives had been accomplished.business history helped secure gulf's backingthe israeli missile attack in doha, which killed a qatari citizen but no senior hamas officials, prompted trump to issue an ultimatum to netanyahu. the war had to stop.trump had given israel a relatively free hand in gaza. he lent american military might to israel's campaign in iran. but an attack on qatar soil was a different matter entirely, moving him towards the arab position on how best to end the war.several trump officials have told the bbc's us partner cbs this was a turning point which galvanised the president to exert maximum pressure to get a peace deal done.reutersan emergency arab summit was held in doha after the attackthis us president's close ties with the gulf states are well documented. he has business dealings with qatar and the uae. he began both his presidential terms with state visits to saudi arabia. this year, he also stopped in doha and abu dhabi.his abraham accords, which normalised relations between israel and several muslim states, including the uae, was the biggest diplomatic achievement of his first term.the time he spent in the capitals of the arabian peninsula earlier this year helped change his thinking, says ed husain of the council on foreign relations. the us president did not visit israel on this middle east trip but visited the uae, saudi arabia and qatar where he heard repeated calls to bring an end to the war.world reacts to first stage of gaza peace deal'joy and pain': palestinians celebrate ceasefire dealwhat we know about the 'first phase' of the gaza peace dealless than a month after that israeli strike on doha, trump sat nearby as netanyahu personally phoned qatar to apologise. and later that day, the israeli leader signed off on trump's 20-point peace plan for gaza - one that also had the backing of key muslim nations in the region.if trump's relationship with netanyahu gave him the room to pressure israel to strike a deal, his history with muslim leaders may have secured their support, and helped them convince hamas to commit to the deal.\"one of the things that clearly happened was that president trump developed leverage with the israelis, and indirectly with hamas,\" says jon alterman of the center for strategic and international studies (csis).\"that made a difference. his ability to do this on his timing, and not succumb to the desires of the combatants has been a problem that lot of previous presidents have struggled with, and he seems to do relatively successfully.\"the fact that trump is much more popular in israel than netanyahu himself was leverage that he used to his benefit, he adds.now israel has committed to releasing more than 1,000 palestinians held in israeli prisons and has agreed to a partial withdrawal from gaza.hamas will release all the remaining hostages, living and dead, taken during the original 7 october hamas attack, which resulted in the death of more than 1,200 israelis.an end to the war, which has resulted in the devastation of gaza and the deaths of more than 67,000 palestinians is now imaginable.europeans exert their influencethe global condemnation of israel over its actions in gaza also weighed on trump's thinking.conditions on the ground are unprecedented in terms of destruction and the humanitarian catastrophe for palestinians. over recent months the netanyahu government became increasingly isolated internationally.as israel took military control of the food supply to palestinians and then announced a planned assault on gaza city, several major europeans countries, led by french president emmanuel macron, decided they couldn't stay aligned with washington's position of unequivocal support for israel.reuterspalestinians look out from a window in gaza after the ceasefire announcementa historic split followed between the americans and european allies when it came to key elements of diplomacy and the future of the israeli-palestinian conflict.the trump administration castigated france when it said it would recognise a palestinian state, a move followed by the uk. they were trying to keep the idea of a two-state solution on life support, but more fundamentally marginalise the extremes on both sides and revive a diplomatic path to a shared israeli-palestinian future.but macron was astute in getting the saudis on board for his peace plan.ultimately trump was faced with a european-arab alliance versus israeli nationalists and the far right when it came to visions for gaza's longer term future. he chose his friends in the gulf.analysis: a realistic chance to end the war but not over yetwhat is hamas and why is it fighting israel in gaza?under a french-saudi peace plan, arab countries also issued an unprecedented condemnation of hamas' october 7 attacks and called for the group to end its rule on gaza and hand over its weapons to the palestinian authority under independent statehood.this was a diplomatic win for the arabs and europeans. trump's 20-point plan drew on the france-saudi plan in key areas, including a reference to eventual palestinian \"statehood\" even if this was vague and highly conditional.trump, while asking turkey, qatar and egypt to maintain pressure on hamas, boxed in netanyahu, putting unprecedented pressure on him to end the war.no-one could be the side to say no to trump.trump's unique style unlocked stalematetrump's unorthodox manner still has the capacity to shock. it starts with bluster or bombast but then develops into something more conventional.in his first term, his \"little rocket man\" insults and \"fire and fury\" warnings appeared to be taking the us to the brink of war with north korea. instead he engaged in direct talks.trump kicked off his second term with an eye-popping suggestion that palestinians should be required to relocate from gaza as it was turned into an international oceanfront resort.muslim leaders were incensed. seasoned middle east diplomats were aghast.trump's 20-point peace plan, however, isn't that different from the kind of deal biden would have struck and that america's allies had long endorsed. a blueprint for a gaza riviera it was not.trump has taken a very unconventional path to what is a conventional result. it has been messy. it may not be how they teach diplomacy in ivy league universities. but, at least in this case and at this moment, it has proven effective.tomorrow the nobel committee will announce this year's peace prize winner. and while it is unlikely that trump will be the recipient, that prospect doesn't seem nearly as unlikely as it did just a few weeks ago.additional reporting by kayla epsteinceasefire

over runner-ups for the prize, emmanuel macron and hamas. that s consistent of them, anyway. they only give peace prizes to socialists and jew haters. when hamas discovered than they may have to associate themselves with greta, they reconsidered dealing with the israel es. the lesser of two evils paradox. and why not? they gave b.o. a prize for just sitting there. and algore got a peace prize for global warming cooling change. it s a joke these days. if obama could be nominated for a nobel peace prize so early in his term, october 9, 2009, and was notable for being given so early in his presidency nothing is impossible. that s what made the prize totally and completely worthless. he was in office just 9 months and did nothing to warrant it other than being a black us president. it was essentially a dei award. that scared me for a second. she was nominated for the nobel peace prize in the past. she was also time s person of the year in 2019. then i saw the source. it is not unheard of for the babylon bee to parody something that has come to pass. once again the bee grabs the headlines the lsm really wants to print. the bee should get the nobel, just for stinging so many of you (and on occasion, me as well).   it s a joke these days sure is, which is why i hope they give it to trump, only to have him refuse it, and call out all the misfits who have received it in the recent past. navigation:use the links below to view more comments.first1-20,21-30nextlastdisclaimer:opinions posted on free republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily

    "text": "how trump secured a gaza breakthrough which eluded biden9 october 2025sharesaveanthony zurcher,north america correspondentandtom bateman,state department correspondentsharesavewatch: how trump's relationships helped pull off a gaza dealat the time, israel's air strike against the hamas negotiating team in qatar seemed like yet another escalation that pushed the prospect of peace further away.the attack on 9 september violated the sovereignty of an american ally and risked expanding the conflict into a region-wide war.diplomacy appeared to be in ruins.instead it turned out to be a key moment that has led to a deal, announced by president donald trump, to release all remaining hostages.this is a goal that he, and president joe biden before him, had sought for nearly two years.it is just the first step towards a more durable peace, and the details of hamas disarmament, gaza governance and full israeli withdrawal remain to be negotiated.but if this agreement holds, it could be trump's signature achievement of his second term - one that eluded biden and his diplomatic team.trump's unique style and crucial relationships with israel and the arab world appear to have contributed to this breakthrough.but, as with most diplomatic achievements, there were also factors at play beyond control of either man.getty imagesshoulder to shoulder - trump and netanyahua close relationship that biden never hadin public, trump and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu are all smiles.trump likes to say that israel has no better friend, and netanyahu has described trump as israel's \"greatest ever ally in the white house\". and these warm words have been matched by actions.during his first presidential term, trump moved the us embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem and abandoned a long-held us position that israeli settlements in the palestinian west bank are illegal, the position under international law.when israel began its air strikes against iran in june, trump ordered us bombers to target the nation's nuclear enrichment facilities with its most powerful conventional bombs.those public demonstrations of support may have given trump the room to exert more pressure on israel behind the scenes. according to reports, trump's negotiator, steve witkoff, browbeat netanyahu in late 2024 into accepting a temporary ceasefire in exchange for the release of some hostages.when israel launched strikes against syrian forces in july, trump pressured netanyahu to change course.trump exhibited a degree of will and pressure on an israeli prime minister that is virtually unprecedented, says aaron david miller of the carnegie endowment for international peace. \"there is no example of an american president literally telling an israeli prime minister that you're going to have to comply or else.\"reutersisraelis wave national and us flags after news of the agreementlive: israel approves trump's gaza agreementanalysis: gaza deal is huge moment but just the startbiden's relationship with netanyahu's government was always more tenuous.his administration's \"bear hug\" strategy held that the us had to embrace israel publicly in order to allow it to moderate the nation's war conduct in private.underneath this was biden's nearly half-century of support for israel, as well as sharp divisions within his democratic coalition over the gaza war. every step biden took risked fracturing his own domestic support, whereas trump's solid republican base gave him more room to manoeuvre.in the end, domestic politics or personal relationships may have had less importance than the simple fact that, during biden's presidency, israel was not ready to make peace.eight months into trump's second term, with iran chastened, hezbollah to its immediate north greatly diminished and gaza in ruins, all its major strategy objectives had been accomplished.business history helped secure gulf's backingthe israeli missile attack in doha, which killed a qatari citizen but no senior hamas officials, prompted trump to issue an ultimatum to netanyahu. the war had to stop.trump had given israel a relatively free hand in gaza. he lent american military might to israel's campaign in iran. but an attack on qatar soil was a different matter entirely, moving him towards the arab position on how best to end the war.several trump officials have told the bbc's us partner cbs this was a turning point which galvanised the president to exert maximum pressure to get a peace deal done.reutersan emergency arab summit was held in doha after the attackthis us president's close ties with the gulf states are well documented. he has business dealings with qatar and the uae. he began both his presidential terms with state visits to saudi arabia. this year, he also stopped in doha and abu dhabi.his abraham accords, which normalised relations between israel and several muslim states, including the uae, was the biggest diplomatic achievement of his first term.the time he spent in the capitals of the arabian peninsula earlier this year helped change his thinking, says ed husain of the council on foreign relations. the us president did not visit israel on this middle east trip but visited the uae, saudi arabia and qatar where he heard repeated calls to bring an end to the war.world reacts to first stage of gaza peace deal'joy and pain': palestinians celebrate ceasefire dealwhat we know about the 'first phase' of the gaza peace dealless than a month after that israeli strike on doha, trump sat nearby as netanyahu personally phoned qatar to apologise. and later that day, the israeli leader signed off on trump's 20-point peace plan for gaza - one that also had the backing of key muslim nations in the region.if trump's relationship with netanyahu gave him the room to pressure israel to strike a deal, his history with muslim leaders may have secured their support, and helped them convince hamas to commit to the deal.\"one of the things that clearly happened was that president trump developed leverage with the israelis, and indirectly with hamas,\" says jon alterman of the center for strategic and international studies (csis).\"that made a difference. his ability to do this on his timing, and not succumb to the desires of the combatants has been a problem that lot of previous presidents have struggled with, and he seems to do relatively successfully.\"the fact that trump is much more popular in israel than netanyahu himself was leverage that he used to his benefit, he adds.now israel has committed to releasing more than 1,000 palestinians held in israeli prisons and has agreed to a partial withdrawal from gaza.hamas will release all the remaining hostages, living and dead, taken during the original 7 october hamas attack, which resulted in the death of more than 1,200 israelis.an end to the war, which has resulted in the devastation of gaza and the deaths of more than 67,000 palestinians is now imaginable.europeans exert their influencethe global condemnation of israel over its actions in gaza also weighed on trump's thinking.conditions on the ground are unprecedented in terms of destruction and the humanitarian catastrophe for palestinians. over recent months the netanyahu government became increasingly isolated internationally.as israel took military control of the food supply to palestinians and then announced a planned assault on gaza city, several major europeans countries, led by french president emmanuel macron, decided they couldn't stay aligned with washington's position of unequivocal support for israel.reuterspalestinians look out from a window in gaza after the ceasefire announcementa historic split followed between the americans and european allies when it came to key elements of diplomacy and the future of the israeli-palestinian conflict.the trump administration castigated france when it said it would recognise a palestinian state, a move followed by the uk. they were trying to keep the idea of a two-state solution on life support, but more fundamentally marginalise the extremes on both sides and revive a diplomatic path to a shared israeli-palestinian future.but macron was astute in getting the saudis on board for his peace plan.ultimately trump was faced with a european-arab alliance versus israeli nationalists and the far right when it came to visions for gaza's longer term future. he chose his friends in the gulf.analysis: a realistic chance to end the war but not over yetwhat is hamas and why is it fighting israel in gaza?under a french-saudi peace plan, arab countries also issued an unprecedented condemnation of hamas' october 7 attacks and called for the group to end its rule on gaza and hand over its weapons to the palestinian authority under independent statehood.this was a diplomatic win for the arabs and europeans. trump's 20-point plan drew on the france-saudi plan in key areas, including a reference to eventual palestinian \"statehood\" even if this was vague and highly conditional.trump, while asking turkey, qatar and egypt to maintain pressure on hamas, boxed in netanyahu, putting unprecedented pressure on him to end the war.no-one could be the side to say no to trump.trump's unique style unlocked stalematetrump's unorthodox manner still has the capacity to shock. it starts with bluster or bombast but then develops into something more conventional.in his first term, his \"little rocket man\" insults and \"fire and fury\" warnings appeared to be taking the us to the brink of war with north korea. instead he engaged in direct talks.trump kicked off his second term with an eye-popping suggestion that palestinians should be required to relocate from gaza as it was turned into an international oceanfront resort.muslim leaders were incensed. seasoned middle east diplomats were aghast.trump's 20-point peace plan, however, isn't that different from the kind of deal biden would have struck and that america's allies had long endorsed. a blueprint for a gaza riviera it was not.trump has taken a very unconventional path to what is a conventional result. it has been messy. it may not be how they teach diplomacy in ivy league universities. but, at least in this case and at this moment, it has proven effective.tomorrow the nobel committee will announce this year's peace prize winner. and while it is unlikely that trump will be the recipient, that prospect doesn't seem nearly as unlikely as it did just a few weeks ago.additional reporting by kayla epsteinceasefire

istshareaa+text sizesmallmediumlargechina puts more curbs on exports of rare earths, techhong kong: china outlined new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies on thursday, extending controls over use of the elements critical for many high-tech and military products ahead of a meeting in about three weeks between president donald trump and chinese leader xi jinping.the regulations announced by the ministry of commerce require foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from china. these critical minerals are needed in a broad range of products, from jet engines, radar systems and electric vehicles to consumer electronics including laptops and phones.beijing also will impose permitting requirements on exports of technologies related to rare earths mining, smelting, recycling and magnet-making, it said.china accounts for nearly 70% of the world's rare earths mining. it also controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing. access to such materials is a key point of contention in trade talks between washington and beijing.as trump has raised tariffs on imports of many products from china, beijing has doubled down on controls on the strategically vital minerals, raising concerns over potential shortages for manufacturers in the us and elsewhere.it was not immediately clear how china plans to enforce the new policies overseas.during a cabinet meeting thursday, trump said he had yet to be briefed on the new rules but suggested that the us could stop buying chinese goods. \"we import from china massive amounts,\" trump said. \"maybe we'll have to stop doing that.\"neha mukherjee, a rare earths analyst at benchmark mineral intelligence, called the new export controls \"a strategic move by china that mirror some of washington's new chip export rules.\"most rare earth magnet manufacturers in the u.s., japan and elsewhere remain heavily dependent on rare earths from china, so these restrictions will force some difficult decisions - especially for any company involved in military uses of rare earths because most of those export licenses are expected to be denied, he said.\"the message is clear: if the u.s. and its allies want supply chain security, they must build independent value chains from mine to magnet,\" mukherjee said.the new restrictions are to \"better safeguard national security\" and to stop uses in \"sensitive fields such as the military\" that stem from rare earths processed or sourced from china or from its related technologies, the commerce ministry said.it said some unnamed \"overseas bodies and individuals\" had transferred rare earths elements and technologies from china abroad for military or other sensitive uses which caused \"significant damage\" to its national security.the new curbs were announced just weeks ahead of an expected meeting between trump and chinese president xi jinping on the sidelines of the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum in south korea, that begins at the end of this month.\"rare earths will continue to be a key part of negotiations for washington and beijing,\" george chen, a partner at the asia group, said in an emailed comment. \"both sides want more stability but there will be still a lot of noises before the two leaders, president trump and xi, can make a final deal next year when they meet.those noises are all negotiation tactics.\"these new restrictions will likely prompt additional government and private investments in developing a mine-to-magnet supply chain outside of china. mukherjee said that $520 million of investments in the american rare earths industry were announced just in the second quarter with most of that coming from the government.and there is some progress already being made with american magnet maker noveon announcing an agreement with lynas rare earths this week to secure a supply of rare earths outside of china from lynas' mine in australia, and mp materials preparing to begin producing magnets later this year at its new plant in texas that uses rare earths from the only u.s.mine that it operates in california.in july, the u.s. defense department agreed to invest $400 million in shares of the las vegas company, establish a floor for the price of key elements, and ensure that all of the magnets made at a new plant in the first 10 years are purchased.an mp materials spokesperson said china's action \"reinforces the need for forward-leaning u.s. industrial policy. building resilient supply chains is a matter of economic and national security.\"wade senti, president of the u.s. permanent magnet company aml, said it's time to innovate.\"the game of chess that china is playing underscores the importance of developing innovation that changes the game and puts the united states in leading position,\" senti said.nazak nikakhtar, a former commerce department undersecretary, said the new restrictions are \"a significant development and escalation\" by extending controls to related technology and equipment and to sectors like chipmakers.\"this should be a wake-up call to the u.s. government that we need to invest in and appropriate more to domestic capabilities. both are critical to rebuild america's rare earths industrial base,\" she said.in april, chinese authorities imposed export curbs on seven rare earth elements shortly after trump unveiled his steep tariffs on many trading partners including china.while supplies remain uncertain, china approved some permits for rare earth exports in june and said it was speeding up its approval processes.end of articlefollow us on social mediavideosamerica 360: trump calls for democrat governor's arrest as america burns over ice

    "text": "the little things you do every day can have a big effect on how well you protect your heart.cardiologistssay that one easy thing you can do in the afternoon, snacking on something high in fiber, can help lowercholesteroland lower your risk of heart disease. and yet, most americans aren't taking advantage of this simple solution.why do you need to eat more fiber?heart disease is still one of the most common causes of death in the us, and high cholesterol is a big part of the problem. some people are born with high cholesterol, but what they eat is very important. cardiologists say that a simple habit you can do in the afternoon, like eating a snack high in fiber, can help lower your cholesterol levels, as per a report by eating well.also read: donald trump to win nobel peace prize tomorrow? leading bookmaker show him as the second favorite fiber, particularly soluble fiber, binds cholesterol in the intestinal tract and prevents it from being absorbed,  explains dr. elizabeth klodas, m.d., facc. studies back this up: one meta-analysis found that consuming an additional 5 grams of soluble fiber daily lowered ldl cholesterol by more than 5 mg/dl. regular fiber intake also helps lower total cholesterol and triglycerides, as per a report by eating well.live eventshow does fiber help you keep your weight down?obesity and high cholesterol often go together, at least in part because of inflammation and insulin resistance.  fiber can make you feel full, which is helpful to limit portion size,  states cardiologist matthew j. bocchese, m.d. fiber takes longer to digest than processed carbs, so you feel full for longer, as per a report by eating well.dr. klodas says that fiber affects hormones that control hunger. \"fiber is also the food for the bacteria in the microbiome that make glp-1 (the same molecule asozempic or wegovy). this means that fiber helps control appetite and leads to weight loss naturally by lowering calorie intake,\" she says.this natural way of controlling hunger not only helps you lose weight, but it also makes your heart healthier in general, as per a report by eating well.also read: epstein bomb about to explode   100 republicans ready to flee trump, swalwell claimscan fiber help reduce inflammation?fiber is important for lowering inflammation, which is another cause of heart disease, in addition to its effects on cholesterol and weight. fiber feeds the bacteria in your gut, which makes short-chain fatty acids that lower inflammation.registered dietitian michelle routhenstein, m.s., rd, cdces, cdn, emphasizes the importance of an anti-inflammatory diet.  beyond fiber, we also want to add foods that combat inflammation, since even with normal cholesterol levels, chronic inflammation can increase cardiovascular risk, particularly in women,  she says.  a nutrient-adequate diet that includes b vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, zinc and polyphenols has been shown to help lower markers of inflammation, such as hscrp,  as per a report by eating well.how does fiber keep blood sugar levels stable? in addition to directly decreasing cholesterol absorption, fiber can help regulate blood sugar,  explains dr. bocchese. since insulin plays a major role in cholesterol production, keeping blood sugar steady is key for lowering cholesterol naturally, as per a report by eating well.fiber slows down digestion, which keeps blood sugar from going up and down too quickly. research shows that people with type 2 diabetes who eat more fiber have better fasting glucose and hba1c levels, which show how well they are controlling their blood sugar over time. combining carbs with fiber, healthy fats, and protein helps keep blood sugar levels stable and is good for the heart.what are some simple snack ideas that are high in fiber?one of the easiest ways to get more fiber in your diet is to snack wisely. experts say that instead of processed snacks, you should eat whole foods and try to get 22 to 34 grams of fiber every day, depending on your age and sex.here are some quick, heart-healthy snack ideas:a handful of nuts and an applechickpeas roasted with cucumbers cut into sliceshummus and bell peppersraspberries on top of plain greek yogurta spoonful of nut butter in oatmeallemon-blueberry energy balls or vegetable soupwhen you buy snacks in a package, make sure that each serving has at least 3 grams of fiber and not too much added sugar or salt.what other tips can help lower cholesterol?fiber is important for heart health, but it's not the only thing. cardiologists also stress how important it is to live a healthy lifestyle and eat a balanced diet.dr. bocchese says, \"regular exercise, in addition to all of its other heart and mental health benefits, can help lower cholesterol by speeding up your body's metabolism of cholesterol and lowering or preventing insulin resistance.\" taking short walks or breaks to stretch during the day can help.increase your lycopene intake: routhenstein says that eating cooked tomatoes and red bell peppers can help you get more lycopene, which is known to lower inflammation and support hdl (good) cholesterol.routhenstein says, \"eat fatty fish like salmon, sardines, or mackerel to improve hdl function, which helps recycle ldl cholesterol back to the liver.\"avoid saturated fats and added sugars. cutting back on sugar, salt, and butter and choosing healthy fats like olive or avocado oil can help keep cholesterol levels healthy over time.note:this article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice. always consult your doctor regarding any medical concerns.faqswhat is the best thing to do in the afternoon to lower cholesterol?experts say that eating a snack high in fiber every day can help lower ldl cholesterol and inflammation.what does fiber do for heart health?fiber binds cholesterol in the intestines, slows down absorption, helps with weight control, and keeps blood sugar levels stable.addas a reliable and trusted news sourceadd now!(you can now subscribe to oureconomic times whatsapp channel)read more news onozempic or wegovyfiber promotes healthy blood sugar levels1 afternoon habit that can slash your cholesterolslash your cholesterol levelcholesterolhealth wellnesscardiologists(catch all theus news,uk news,canada news, international breaking news events, and latest news updates on the economic times.)download the economic times news app to get dailyinternational newsupdates....moreless(you can now subscribe to oureconomic times whatsapp channel)read more news onozempic or wegovyfiber promotes healthy blood sugar levels1 afternoon habit that can slash your cholesterolslash your cholesterol levelcholesterolhealth wellnesscardiologists(catch all theus news,uk news,canada news, international breaking news events, and latest news updates on the economic times.)download the economic times news app to get dailyinternational newsupdates....moreless"

received a private briefing and a memo from pollster geoff garin.the crux of the message: stay the course because democrats are winning the battle of public opinion. voters continue to blame trump and republicans more than democrats for the shutdown,  said the memo, which was obtained by nbc news and featured new polling data conducted by hart research, with findings that are backed by otherpublic national surveyson the shutdown fight.it added that voters are siding with democrats  health care funding demands, that  republicans are starting to feel the heat  on the issue and that the gop s political pain will worsen  the longer and more aggressively  democrats litigate it.republicans need five more democratic votes to break a filibuster and pass their bill to reopen the government on a temporary basis and buy time for a larger spending deal. on thursday, the senate voted again   for the seventh time   on that plan and a democratic alternative. no senators budged.instead, democratic leaders, emboldened and energized, are taking every opportunity to highlight their central demand: extend the expiring obamacare subsidies to avoid health insurance premium hikes or coverage losses for millions of americans next year. insurers are already sending out notices of upcoming rate hikes in the mail, and bringing costs back down will get messy if congress waits until the end of the year to act.republican leaders, facing a divided conference with many members who want to end the subsidies, are refusing to make any promises on the issue. instead, they say, democrats must vote to reopen the government, and then the two parties can discuss the subsidies.the pivot to health care has frustrated house speaker mike johnson, r-la. they re trying to make this about health care. it s not. it s about keeping congress operating so we can get to health care. we always were going to. they re lying to you,  johnson told reporters. the health care issues were always going to be

resolve the long-term future of the gaza strip, with uncertainty over its directive for hamas to disband, as well as the governance of the shattered enclave.the plan, which was mediated by qatar, turkey and egypt, will also need formal agreement by israel s government. a spokesperson for the office of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said thursday that a ceasefire would then take

re doing is getting our hostages back. and that s whatpeople wanted more than anything else,  trump said during a cabinet meeting   as he outlined plans to travel to egypt sunday for an in-person signing event followed by a speech to the israeli knesset on a  day of great celebration.  after that, we ll see, but they have agreed to things and i think it s going to move along pretty well,  trump said of themajor diplomatic achievement.4president trump celebrated the israel-hamas peace agreement thursday.reutersthe president s top advisers took turns applauding the commander in chief and crediting him with ending two years of carnage that began with hamas s surprise attack on israel on oct. 7, 2023. very soon, we re going to see 20 living human beings emerge from the darkness into the light for the first time in two years,  said secretary of state marco rubio, who said that many of trump s behind-the-scenes moves to reach a deal may never be known. our country should be very proud we have a president who s committed to not just peace, but to the human aspect of uniting these families,  rubio told trump.vice president jd vance, meanwhile, noted the role of trump s close friend and special middle east envoy steve witkoff and son-in-law jared kushner   with vance saying the team defied significant media skepticism to reach the initial deal during talks in egypt.when a journalist asked trump to identify the contours of phase two, however, the president said,  i m not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. but there will be disarming, there will be pullbacks, there will be a lot of things that are happening. trump s20-point peace proposal, which hamas tentatively accepted oct. 3, calls for a three-stage pullback of israeli troops from the gaza strip s urban core and for  arab and international partners to develop a temporary international stabilization force (isf) to immediately deploy in gaza. 4secretary of state marco rubio

those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return.  nobody s going to be forced to leave,  trump reiterated during an afternoon event with finnish president alexander stubb.earlier in the year, trump proposed relocating gaza s inhabitants to make way for a us-owned  riviera of the middle east,  but the peace blueprint instead proposes a  special economic zone  in gaza and a transitional government overseen by a trump-chaired board of peace.the president said that gaza s future will be buoyed by wealthy arab neighbors set to finance an ambitious economic development plan for the roughly 2 million-person region.4about 20 living hostages are expected to be released.reuters we are going to work with very wealthy countries that love people, frankly. i know them very well, they love people, but they love arab people and they love muslims, but i think right now they love everybody,  trump said during the cabinet meeting. they are immensely wealthy and they re going to be involved in putting up money. and for them it s a small amount of money. for somebody else it s a large amount of money, but these are the wealthiest countries in the world and they will be very much involved in making it as good as possible. trump said hisjune 21 airstrikes on iran s nuclear programwere  very important  due to the fact that hamas-allied tehran would have cast a  dark cloud  over

compensated on the earliest date possible after the lapse ends  in accordance with the government employee fair treatment act of 2019. but that was apparently an overstep: the irs corrected itself the following day, stating that it would defer to the direction of russel vought s office of management and budget. an earlier memo circulated on furlough guidance incorrectly stated the nature of the government employee fair treatment act of 2019 as it relates to compensation for non-pay and non-duty status,  the irspostedon its x account thursday.  omb will provide further guidance on this issue, you will be updated accordingly. an irs employee that spoke withfederal news networksaid that the initial email was automatically deleted from staff email inboxes by thursday.back pay for furloughed workers has been a point of contention throughout the eight-day government shutdown, despite the fact that it s legally mandated. donald trump himself signed thebipartisan-supported lawafter the last government shutdown, which lasted a record 35 days from 2018 into 2019.on tuesday, omb tested the waters with potentially flouting the law, circulating a draft legal opinion indicating that furloughed federal workers would no longer be guaranteed back pay. instead, the agency announced that members of congress would need to specifically address the back pay provisions in a stopgap spending bill.house speaker mike johnson, who voted in favor of the 2019 law,told reporterswednesday that it was his  understanding that the law is that they would be paid.  there is some other legal analysis that s floating around. i haven t yet had time to dig into and read that. but it has always been the case that is, tradition and i think statutory law that federal employees be paid,  johnson said in anews conference.  and that s my position. i think they should be. they should not be subjected to harm and financial dire straits. share this storyread more about federal backpay:trump says which

troops have entered chicago to work with immigration and customs enforcement officers, the trump administration posted a video on x wednesday to hype up its federal law enforcement operations in chicago.  an incompetent mayor. a delusional governor. chicago is in chaos, and the american people are paying the price,  the postread.  chicago doesn t need political spin it needs help. but spin was all that the white house had to offer because the video contained some footage that had nothing to do with chicago at all.the promotional video devolved into an onslaught of chaotic arrest footage, showing officers clad in tactical gear moving through the night to kick down doors and drag people out of their cars as chicago pastor corey brooks s voice urged the city to welcome trump s advances.butthe daily beastreported wednesday that some of the footage was actually fromoperation tidal wave, a state-wide operation in florida that led to the arrests of 1,120 people, only63 percentof whom had a criminal record.in fact, one shot that was used twice in the video about chicago could be spotted infootagethe dhs published in may of their work in the sunshine state. palm trees were visible in some of the shots included in the new video, clearly demonstrating that the footage was not all from the windy city.illinois governor jb pritzker s spokesperson slammed the white house for their fake video.  we are proud that chicago was just ranked the best big city in the united states. we are proud of its beautiful beaches, booming businesses, and decent people. however, we cannot claim credit for many palm trees here,  spokesperson matt hill told the beast. we know the lies don t just come out of their mouth. so it s not surprising that the trump team spends more time producing videos purporting images of florida as illinois rather than spending any time to lower prices or protect healthcare for hardworking americans,  hill added.the video also included footage of the chicago skyline and streets from above, and images of pritzker and chicago mayor brandon johnson. earlier this week, trump claimed the two democratic officialsought to be imprisoned.clearly, trump sattempt to wage waron american cities requires a subsequent disinformation campaign. earlier this week, the oregon republican partyshared a graphicabout dangerous riots in portland but the images weren t from that city either.the trump administration has also used its excessive federal law enforcement response to make content that pushes the narrative that the united states has descended into chaos at the hands of democratic leaders. earlier this month, dhs used footage from ahorrific raidon a chicago apartment building where ice officers dragged young children from their homes in zip-ties to makeanother promotional video.share this storyread more about troop deployments:ice barbie says an entire state s worth of officials are  lying most recent postnew york attorney general letitia james was indicted thursday for alleged mortgage fraud, following president donald trump s months-long campaign to remove his outspoken critic from office.interim u.s. attorney lindsey halligan for the eastern district of virginia reportedly personally presented the government sflimsy casealleging that james committed mortgage fraud. halligan, who was previously trump s personal attorney before becoming special assistant to the president,recently replacederic siebert, who trump officials hadpressuredto seek an indictment against james.james was indicted on one count of bank fraud, according tomsnbc.multiple sources toldabc newslast month that investigators had yet to produce a shred of evidence that james falsified bank documents to secure favorable terms on a mortgage for her virginia home. two trump stooges, federal housing finance agency director bill pulte, and ed martin, the head of the doj s working weaponization group, have staked their claim that james committed mortgage fraud on a single document claiming that the home she purchased in 2023 would be her primary residence.but investigators haven t been able to prove she knowingly lied, or that the document was even considered by loan officers. lawyers that drafted the document said the error was the result of a template that wasn t corrected, sources told abc news. every other document submitted for james s mortgage accurately stated she would not reside at the home.pulte and martin reportedly urged siebert to seek an indictment against james at trump s direction. when siebert declined, pulte reportedly encouraged trump to fire siebert and have him replaced with someone else.in abizarre poston truth social last month, which wasrevealedto be an errant dm to attorney general pam bondi, trump wrote:  lindsey is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot.  he later reposted this rant, clarifying that he was writing about halligan, and politico legal reporter kyle cheney suggested that trump hoped to replace siebert with halligan to pursue his supposedly  great case  against james.this story has been updated.share this storyread more about trump s case against james:trump must be furious that

ceremony its government has no involvement in deciding who wins. but with hours on the clock before the nobel peace prize recipient is named, norway s politicians are sweating that trump may not know the difference.kirsti bergst , the leader of norway s socialist left party, toldthe guardianthat oslo must be  prepared for anything.  donald trump is taking the u.s. in an extreme direction, attacking freedom of speech, having masked secret police kidnapping people in broad daylight and cracking down on institutions and the courts. when the president is this volatile and authoritarian, of course we have to be prepared for anything,  bergst  told the international newspaper. the nobel committee is an independent body and the norwegian government has no involvement in determining the prizes,  she continued.  but i m not sure trump knows that. we have to be prepared for anything from him. the nobel prize committee announced thursday that it had decided the prize winner at the beginning of the week, before the trump administration brokered a ceasefire arrangement between israel and gaza. timeframe considered,  most nobel experts and norwegian observers believe it is highly unlikely that trump will be awarded the prize, the guardianreported.it s no secret that trump has pined for the international honor: the u.s. presidentphonednorway s finance minister jens stoltenberg  out of the blue  back in july to inquire about the possibility of acquiring the prize, using tariffs as a cover for their discussion.trump has complained for years that his name has not yet been added to the ranks of prize recipients, who span some of the greatest figures of the last century, including nelson mandela, martin luther king jr., mother theresa, and malala yousafzai.part of the contention could be that trump s supposed political nemesis, former president barack obama, received the award in 2009 for  extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.  three other u.s. presidents have also won a nobel peace prize. they gave it to obama for absolutely destroying our country,  trump said, during an oval office meeting with finnish president alexander stubb thursday.  my election was much more important. trump s obsession with obtaining the prize has led to some odd boasts over the last several months, including that he has resolved eight wars around the globe in his second term alone. trump has so far claimed responsibility for peace between the democratic republic of the congo and the republic of rwanda, between cambodia and thailand, between israel and iran, between india and pakistan, between serbia and kosovo, between egypt and ethiopia, between armenia and azerbaijan, and for  doing the abraham accords,  all while complaining about a lack of recognition by the norway-based judges  panel.aszeteo s mehdi hasanpointed out last month, all of trump s war-solving braggadocio is  demonstrably untrue,  to the extent that several of the listed examples were never even at war. nobody in history has solved eight wars in a period of nine months. and i ve stopped eight wars, so that s never happened before. but they ll have to do what they do. whatever they do is fine. i know this: i didn t do it for that, i did it because i saved a lot of lives,  trump said thursday while answering a barrage of questions about the prize.  but nobody s done eight wars. share this storyread more about trump:trump s nobel peace prize obsession is getting way out of handmost recent postpresident trump s gaza ceasefire

that forces palestinians out of their homes and puts redevelopment into the hands of the u.s., israel, and tony blair isn t a deal it s ethnic cleansing. this deal is also contingent upon israel lifting the aid blockade and ending its genocidal attacks once the hostages are returned, but even that is not a guarantee. looking ahead, what guarantees hamas disarms, and that israel doesn t resume bombing once the hostages are released?  another reporter asked. well the first thing we re doing is getting our hostages back, ok? and that s what people wanted more than anything else, they wanted these hostages back that have lived in hell like nobody has ever even dreamt possible,  trump said.  after that, we ll see. but they ve agreed to things, and i think it s gonna move along pretty well. israel  agreed to things  in the short-lived ceasefire of november 2023, which it broke on the very first day when the idfopened fireon gazans returning to their homes. when asked how this time would be any different, all the president could say was,  we ll see. share this storymost recent posthealth secretary robert f. kennedy jr., who has drawn widespread criticism for manipulating science to fit his agenda, admitted that he is working to  make the proof  to support his controversial claim that the use of acetaminophen, or tylenol, during pregnancy causes autism.kennedy mentioned tylenol at a thursday cabinet meeting because, he said, he d been disturbed by a social media video:  somebody showed me a tiktok video of a pregnant woman at eight months pregnant she s an associate professor at the columbia medical school and she is saying  f trump  and gobbling tylenol with her baby in her placenta,  he recalled. it is not immediately clear what video he was referring to, and babies are not in the placenta, but attached to it, in pregnancy.the health secretary went on to cite a number of studies that allegedly support his tylenol suspicions. then he made an eyebrow-raising statement about the existing evidence:  it is not proof,  kennedy said.  we re doing the studies tomake the proof. rfk jr on tylenol and autism: \"it is not proof. we're doing the studies to make the proof.\"pic.twitter.com/57h9bjnyol  aaron rupar (@atrupar)october 9, 2025according to theamerican academy of pediatricsand american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, it is safe for women to use acetaminophen occasionally  as directed for fever and pain relief during pregnancy,  and patients should talk with their obstetrician about pain relief, as with all medications, during pregnancy.rfk jr. s stated plan to invent evidence to back up his controversial claim to the contrary has already drawn ridicule online.  ah yes, wrotedr. michelle au, a physician, public health advocate, and democratic state legislator in georgia,  the scientific method famously instructs us to predetermine a conclusion and then do studies to  make the proof.  but  make the proof  is a fitting credo for a man reshaping the public health system as kennedy is now. the health secretary in june dismissed the cdc s entire advisory committee on immunization practices; installed his own

thursday, noem excoriated portland mayor keith wilson, oregon governor tina kotek, and portland police chief bob day, after her surprise visit to a u.s. immigration and customs enforcement facility in the south portland neighborhood earlier this week. i   met with the governor, met with the mayor, met with the chief of police, and the superintendent of the highway patrol. they re all lying, and disingenuous, and dishonest people,  she said.  because as soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response. so, we re looking at new facilities to purchase there in portland too. and we re gonna double down. and i told them if they didn t meet our demands for safety and security on the streets then we re going to bring in more federal law enforcement,  she added.but noem s trip tuesday revealed that portland isn t the war zone the president claims.local officials have continued to undermine the trump administration s outlandish claims about portland. kotek, who got wind of noem s visit,reportedlymet her at the airport, where the governor said she  reiterated again that there is no insurrection in oregon. outside the facility noem visited, there were no hardened terrorists,only a handful of reporters and a guy in a chicken costume. by midday, there were about two dozen protesters, but they were still outnumbered by reporters, according tooregon live. and across the city, organizersthrew a puppy paradeto tell ice to get its paws off portland. still, appearing on fox news later, noemcalledlocal leaders  a bunch of pansies  and said she wanted even more security at the ice facility.wilsonsaidthat the quiet day noem witnessed was proof that  portland continues to manage public safety professionally and responsibly, irrespective of the claims of out-of-state social media influencers. it seems that noem now hopes to punish portland officials for their repeated assertions that they were doing a fine job of managing public safety on their own.on wednesday, during a roundtable of right-wing influencers talking about anti-fascist resistance to the president, noemaccusedwilson and kotek of  covering up the terrorism that is hitting their streets. noem also claimed that portland police officers were  cheering  on protesters that were saying slogans such as  kill ice agents  and  molotov cocktails melt ice. day told kgw8 that noem s claim was an  abhorrent allegation.  since the secretary had several people documenting her movements, we urge her to provide video evidence to support this claim,  he said.  such inflammatory rhetoric undermines trust and distracts from our goal to ensure safety in the south waterfront area. our officers remain professional, dedicated, and committed to serving the people of portland with

congress s  power of the purse.  regardless of trump s bravado, a government shutdown doesn t suddenly suspend the law.it s not the only law that the trump administration has decided could be flouted. so far, the shutdown has furloughed more than half a million federal employees, according to anew york timesmonitor. that includes 89 percent of the environmental protection agency, 87 percent of the education department, and 71 percent of the department of housing and urban development. forty-five percent of the civilian workforce of the defense department has also been temporarily let

maga republican, criticized republican house speaker mike johnson on thursday for delaying the swearing-in of representative-elect adelita grijalva, an arizona democrat.amid the ongoing government shutdown, johnson has cancelled regular house sessions and held off on swearing in grijalva who was elected more than two weeks ago during the brief pro forma sessions taking place in the meantime.but since johnson previously swore in gop representatives during pro formas, democrats are accusing the speaker of dragging his feet due to grijalva s stance on releasing all unclassified documents related to jeffrey epstein. the arizona democrat would provide the deciding, 218th signature on a petition to force a house vote on the epstein files  release.johnson denies that the petition currently signed by 213 democrats, as well as greene and three fellow republicans has anything to do with his reluctance vis- -vis grijalva. i can t conclusively say if that s why the house is not in session, but the house should be in session,  greenetoldcnn on thursday.  and the house should be in session for many reasons. we have appropriation bills that need to get passed. there is a new democrat that s been elected that does deserve to be sworn in. her district elected her. we have other bills that we need to be passing. if johnson is indeed just hoping to avoid the discharge petition, greene said,  why drag this out? that is going to have 218 signatures, and i say go ahead and do it, and get it over with. the georgia republican has proven very willing of late to defy herparty sleadership. also during her cnn interview, for example, greenesaidjohnson and the republican senate majority leader john thune  absolutely  deserve the blame for the shutdown.  we control

(the author)rarely has an award decision electrified the world like a world cup final. frenzied debates erupt across continents: does us president donald trump merit the nobel peace prize?to both champions and critics, the answer seems a no-brainer. yet beneath the surface lies a real conundrum   precisely why the question sparks endless controversy.for trump, the nobel peace prize is a personal trophy, a matter of prestige, not principle; for the world, it counts because it is a powerful global symbol defining what kind of leadership and pursuit of peace is worth celebrating.to reward trump or not to reward him   this is a dilemma perfectly suited to the timeless art of disputation known as thequaestio. latin for question , the name is as elegantly minimalist as calling frank sinatra simply the voice .introduction: the art of disputation 101thequaestiowas the engine that powered the scholastic mind: structured, relentless, and dazzlingly precise.in a veritable intellectual crescendo, a thinker began with a precise, probing question, engaged opposing views, measured the wisdom of authorities, and forged a final answer through disciplined reasoning   honed by conflict and crystalized into piercing, truthful, and enduring insight.the quaestio, presented as a ring composition, prized clarity over chaos, reason over rhetoric. in this gladiatorial arena of the mind, argument was not about winning   it was about thinking better. remarkably concise despite the question s complexity, and mapping the full spectrum of pros and cons, it served as a perfect cheatsheet for analysts and debaters alike.today, thequaestiois an urgently needed tool for reasoning sharply amid the noisy spectacle of public maelstrom. its enduring value is starkly evident in debates about trump, where extreme personality, staged drama, and endless controversy fuel cognitive distortions   mental shortcuts that cloud perception and derail judgment.trump s bombastic tweets, theatrical rallies, and shocking claims hijack attention, feeding vividness bias   the tendency to latch onto dramatic details while losing sight of the full picture. we fixate on the spectacle   the unruly hair, the provocative insult, the radical policy stunt   while substance, brought into relief by nuance, context, and consequence, fades from view.in a hyper-toxic, politicized landscape and climate, thequaestiois a potent, indispensable antidote: elevating intellect over instinct, it sharpens the mind to resist seduction and fosters deliberate, measured, and rigorous thinking   even amid heated debates, relentless polarization, sensational controversies, pervasive chaos, and total confusion.read moreprof. schlevogt s compass no. 30: welcome to the gaza protectorate   when surrender is called peacei. the case for trump (videtur)think of theobiectiones( objections ) as the opening volley with the strongest arguments against the position the debater ultimately defends.often introduced with videtur ( it seems ), this section sets the stage, demonstrating serious engagement with opposing views; it clarifies the stakes, revealing the question s complexity and tension; it primes the ground for credible resolution, making the subsequent thesis and refutations more convincing after the toughest challenges have been preempted. it also doubles as rehearsal for live debate, enabling the debater to foresee and counter the full range of objections.however unpalatable it may be to never-trumpers, three interrelated reasons can be offered for why the us president might, in fact, merit the nobel peace prize.1. cultivating harmonythe bible says, blessed are the peacemakers (matthew 5:9, kjv). those who support trump may contend that where others ignited and prolonged wars, the us president acted as peacemaker-in-chief, fostering understanding and connection across divides through diplomatic breakthroughs.in his first term, the us president facilitated the abraham accords, normalizing relations between israel and several arab nations. in his second, trump claimed to have ended seven unendable wars in only seven months   a boldly oxymoronic play on words, rhetorically sharp if nothing else.2. practicing restrainttrump has seemingly demonstrated a capacity for measured action, reducing us military involvement. supporters argue that this reduced violence and lowered the chance of unintended escalation.he has prioritized withdrawing us troops from protracted, unpopular wars   most notably in afghanistan and the broader middle east   striking deals like the us taliban agreement to scale back america s combat entanglements abroad.3. preserving equilibriumapparently, trump also focused on maintaining stability and preventing escalation. in recent years, he has taken hardline stances and actions, such as striking iranian nuclear sites and resorting to deterrence diplomacy, which supporters claim have held back iran s nuclear ambitions and prevented a greater regional arms race.ii. the guiding authority (sed contra)the sed contra ( but on the contrary ) is a transitional component marking the dramatic pivot of the disputation: after enumerating all objections, the debater invokes authoritative sources as a striking counterpoint, delivering decisive words of wisdom that elegantly pave the way to the ultimate answer.what authority could be better suited to the question at hand than alfred nobel himself, the creator of the eponymous prize?when alfred nobel read his own obituary condemning him as the merchant of death, he saw the looming verdict of history. deeply shocked and full of remorse, he set out to leave a different legacy, one that would celebrate reconciliation rather than destruction.channeling his guilt into generosity, he devoted part of his fortune to establishing the peace prize as a moral counterbalance to the instruments of destruction he had invented   awarding those who build bridges instead of bombs.read moreprof. schlevogt s compass no. 29: peace on powder kegs   balm and bluff in gazain drafting his will in 1895, the chemist and industrialist bequeathed not just a fortune, but a moral compass for the ages to the world. beyond recognizing the greatest benefit on mankind, as his other prizes were also meant to do, nobel stipulated that the peace prize should honor the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. it was an idealistic formula   part moral vision, part political challenge   designed to reward those who turn power toward peace. more than a century later, it remains a formidable test.the five-member norwegian nobel committee interprets that guidance each year, weighing nominations from parliamentarians, academics, former laureates, and other qualified proposers. even though its deliberations are sealed for fifty years, the resulting pattern is clear: the prize recognizes not transactions but transformations.measured against alfred nobel s litmus test, donald trump s record, from his first presidency through his return to power, offers an instructive contrast between ambition and achievement, spectacle and substance   marked by flashes of diplomacy but little lasting peace.1. fraternity between nationstrump s supporters point to the abraham accords, summits with north korea s kim jong-un, and recent ceasefire claims in the caucasus and gaza as evidence of bold statecraft. yet fraternity demands trust, not just photo ops.trump s withdrawals from the iran nuclear deal, the paris climate accord, and other multilateral agreements frayed alliances and deepened suspicion. america first often meant america alone, eroding the cooperative spirit nobel sought to honor.whereas the inventor turned philanthropist envisioned fraternity among nations, trump preached dominance over them, wrapping foreign policy in slogans of supremacy and exclusion. trump s self-centered, unilateralist diplomacy may produce lucrative deals, but not enduring peace.2. abolition or reduction of armiestrump also fails nobel s second test. us military spending and arms sales grew sharply under his watch, while his administration dismantled key arms-control treaties such as the inf and open skies accords.despite talk of new disarmament initiatives, none has materialized. his so-called end to endless wars largely substituted drones and contractors for soldiers   a shift in tactics, not philosophy.3. promotion of peace congressestrump staged summits that dominated headlines, but nobel s peace congresses implied enduring frameworks for mediation and trust. no such institutions emerged under trump s watch. his diplomacy was personalistic, episodic, and often transactional   driven by optics rather than structure.in conclusion, measured against nobel s will, trump is a showman of peace rather than its architect. his initiatives produced headlines, not harmony; leverage, not equality.by the 1895 standard   international brotherhood, disarmament, and enduring institutions   trump falls dramatically short of alfred nobel s vision. granting him the peace prize would leave the nobel committee exposed to future embarrassment at the hands of a decorated andunhingedfigure.the peace prize was meant to transcend power and vanity, not validate and glorify them; far from a medal for treacherous self-interest, it demands nobility and humility.in an ironic twist, trump disqualifies himself from the nobel prize precisely because he craves it too intensely   his obsession becoming its own undoing. in contrast, a leader indifferent to accolades faces virtually no limits.the harder we clutch desire, the more it slips through our fingers. who, seeking nothing but canonization, became a saint? an anxious lover repels the beloved; a golfer overanalyzes the perfect swing and botches it; a writer forces inspiration only to meet a blank page   all proof that obsession often backfires.napoleon s relentless hunger for power pushed him to conquer all of europe, yet the very intensity of his ambition led him into the russian winter and the ruins of exile, his dreams undone by their own gravity.determined to resist political pressure from figure like trump, the nobel committee would likely uphold this guiding principle: peace prizes aren t for performers. they re for those who bleed quietly so others don t have to. the inventor who once armed the world dreamed, at last, of disarming its pride. to honor trump would be to reload it.read moreprof. schlevogt s compass no. 28: the self-coronation of trump   peace or puppet show in gaza?iii. the case against trump (respondeo)the respondeo ( i answer ) is the heart of the argument, settling the debate   the author s direct, answer to the question posed, synthesizing authority and reason in a coherent, logical argument. at its best, this final verdict demonstrates intellectual mastery by showing how complex or conflicting points can be harmonized, turning scattered contention into clarity.the overall verdict is clear and simple: trump is literally ig-nobel . measured against both a traditional and innovative yardstick, trump has failed to live up to alfred nobel s three-fold ideals and thus does not deserve the nobel peace prize.the time-honored standard: the traditional interpretation of nobel s triadthough few nobel peace prize winners have ever fulfilled all three of alfred nobel s original criteria   fraternity between nations, disarmament, and the promotion of peace congresses   the triad remains the moral core of the prize.past nobel laureates like bertha von suttner and l on bourgeois embodied the sublime triptych fully; others, from martin luther king jr. to malala yousafzai, reflected only parts of it, as the nobel committee broadened peace to include justice, human rights, and humanitarian work.but donald trump, as a head of state wielding armies and treaties, carries a unique responsibility to uphold the full spirit of nobel s will, and must be measured by its complete standard, not a modern, flexible reading. nobel certainly wrote his will with leader like him in mind   those who hold the power to wage or restrain war.and by that measure, the record is unforgiving: trump s diplomacy has generated headlines, but fraternity has frayed, disarmament stalled, and peace institutions weakened. the will s words still stand   and by them, trump falls short.an innovative yardstick: enlightened multilateralism 2.0we have now reached the innermost core and crux of the quaestio, central in place and essence alike. at this critical juncture, the question of trump s nobel worthiness comes most sharply into focus.viewing trump solely through a western-centric lens yields a one-sided assessment of his nobel prospects. serving as a counterweight to the faltering western order, a new paradigm   one that rejects destructive liberalism and embraces the traditional east   offers a fairer measure: i call it nation-focused multicentricity   enlightened multilateralism 2.0   grounded morally in tradition, politically in equality among sovereign, peace-forging nations, and economically in what might be termed a transeurasian growth triangle .by innovatively reimagining peace as a harmonious concert of sovereign nations in genuine fraternity, this new model could advance alfred nobel s objectives in a post-modern context.measured against the standard of multicentric mutual sovereignty, trump once again falls short. a self-serving nationalist strongman, he exalts his own nation and coerces others, turning patriotism into rivalry and replacing fraternity with force. rather than fostering harmony, his notorious bullying breeds tension, stoking regional and global sparks that threaten to ignite the next great war   in essence, sowing precisely the discord the nobel ideal sought to avert.refuting the counterarguments (ad obiectiones)think of thead obiectiones  (sc. replies) to objections   as the debater s mic drop that closes the argumentative loop: here s why your objections don t stick. this final round of meticulous rebuttal ensures that every counterargument is carefully considered and resolved, transforming each doubt into an opportunity to reinforce the credibility of the conclusion. once more, the debater demonstrates rigor, showcasing both thoroughness and logical precision.proponents may claim that donald trump s actions merit the nobel peace prize, yet a closer examination exposes profound shortcomings. in diplomacy, his initiatives often produced spectacle rather than lasting understanding; in military affairs, his posture favored coercion over restraint; in matters of international stability, his policies amplified tension rather than fostering fraternity.reply to objection 1: cultivating harmonyquotes from scripture alone are no proof   even the devil cited the bible when he tempted jesus in the desert.consider this: the bible even says, there is no god (psalm 53:1, kjv). context matters, though   the startling claim is introduced by the words, the fool hath said in his heart !the aforementioned peacemaker verse must be read alongside the opening of the beatitudes: blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. (matthew 5:3, kjv). poor in spirit has many layers of meaning, but one is freedom from self-centeredness   a quality trump clearly does not exhibit, his pride remaining a defining trademark. beyond this inner disposition, his actions have achieved little more than a fragile calm at best.trump s approach to diplomacy has been characterized by transactional dealings and a disregard for multilateral institutions, raising serious questions about the sustainability and inclusivity of his peace initiatives.the abraham accords, often cited as a hallmark of trump s diplomatic success, facilitated normalization between israel and several arab nations. however, critics contend that these agreements overlooked the palestinian issue, potentially entrenching regional divisions rather than fostering comprehensive peace. the omission has been cited as a factor contributing to subsequent escalations in the region, including the launch of israel s war on gaza in 2023.similarly, the economic normalization agreements between serbia and kosovo, while historic, have been criticized for their superficial nature. kosovo s independence, declared in 2008, remains unrecognized by serbia and several other countries, rendering the agreements less impactful than portrayedsimilar doubts linger as regards the other wars that trump claimed he has ended   including a non-existing war between albania and azerbaijan   given the emphasis on quick-win ceasefires without a resolution of the root causes of the conflicts.read moreprof. schlevogt s compass no. 27: unraveling the gaza peace ploy   vital questions buried by hypereply to objection 2: practicing restraintwhile trump emphasized reducing us military involvement, actual developments on the ground revealed glaring shortcomings.trump s administration professed to reduce u.s. military involvement, most notably through the u.s.-taliban agreement. however, the subsequent rapid collapse of the afghan government in 2021 and the resurgence of the taliban highlighted the agreement s lack of foresight and its failure to ensure lasting stability.additionally, trump s approach to military intervention has been inconsistent. in 2020, he ordered the extrajudicial killing of qasem soleimani, a top iranian military commander widely considered the second-most powerful figure in the islamic republic. legal experts deemed the strike unlawful. while advocating restraint, his administration later authorized airstrikes on iranian targets, escalating tensions in the middle east and contradicting the principles of de-escalation.the administration also contributed to war that israel launched on gaza in 2023 by providing financial support, weapons, and diplomatic cover to the jewish state. in his war on drugs, trump opened a new front by targeting suspected drug traffickers in international waters.domestically, trump s threats to invoke the insurrection act to deploy troops domestically raised concerns about the politicization of military power and the potential erosion of democratic norms.reply to objection 3. preserving equilibriumtrump also made several disruptive moves that unsettled fragile geopolitical equilibria. far from acting as an integrator, he often sowed division rather than fostering peace. his disregard for expert intelligence and preference for unilateral military action have been cited as key factors contributing to increased instability.trump s administration took a hardline stance on iran, enacting policies criticized for exacerbating regional instability, prompting iran to accelerate its nuclear program rather than deterring it.trump s withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa) in 2018   a major shift in us foreign policy   and subsequent actions undermined multilateral efforts to address nuclear proliferation, raising concerns about the long-term effectiveness of his approach.trump s aforementioned decision to strike iranian nuclear facilities in 2025, despite intelligence assessments suggesting iran was not pursuing nuclear weapons, has been labeled as patently illegal by critics. but this unilateral action not only violated international law, but it also undermined efforts aimed at regional stability.in conclusion, while the supporters of trump, a convicted felon, are highlighting certain diplomatic achievements, a comprehensive evaluation reveals a pattern of actions that often undermine long-term peace and stability, contradicting the ideals upheld by the nobel peace prize.in particular, trump s approach often prioritizes short-term gains and personal accolades over enduring diplomatic solutions and adherence to international norms, while policy implementation is plagued by glaring inconsistencies. for these reasons, his candidacy for the nobel peace prize cannot be endorsed.conclusion: in search of multicentric statecraftfrom the man who invented and produced dynamite was born a prize for those who defuse conflict, ensuring that nobel s name would stand not for war s instruments but for peace s possibility.his peace prize honors restraint as much as initiative, and structure as much as style. to merit it, a leader must be a true integrator and do more than broker deals: he must cultivate trust, protect freedom (including media freedom), uphold the rule of law domestically and internationally, dismantle the machinery of war, promote global cooperation, and nurture the institutions that sustain peace.by that enduring measure, trump   explosive in nature, yet far from tamed   remains well outside nobel s design. his mindset of blunt domination clashes with the integrative skills required to lead a balanced, multicentric world, one that prizes restraint over dominance and shared responsibility over endless unilateral intervention. in this emerging global arena, gordian knots cannot be cut with a sword, nor can an egg be made to stand upright simply by cracking its base.who, then, would be a worthy contender for the nobel peace prize   a leader capable of meeting the demands of a multicentric statesman acting as peacemaker-in-chief?in today s era of enlightened multilateralism 2.0   centering on cooperation of equal, sovereign nations   sheikh mohammed al thani, qatar s prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, stands out as a competent peace-leader for a complex, turbulent world.bridging east and west and embodying resilient courage, he has mediated between hamas and israel, even after his country was bombed by the jewish state. qatar s hosting of al jazeera, a fearless media voice challenging western dominance, adds to the symbolic stature.greta thunberg, by contrast, advances peace through global civic activism, championing green transformation and palestinian sovereignty, influencing states from outside formal power structures. her courageous activism   from embarking on an aid flotilla bound for gaza to confronting israeli patrols   reflects principled conviction matched with bold action, even when it risks alienating her supporters.both personalities fit the new paradigm   one through multicentric statesmanship and diplomacy, the other through transnational advocacy and principled pressure   highlighting how a multicentric view expands the definition of what constitutes meaningful contributions to peace.                                             haunted by the power of his own inventions, alfred nobel, though swedish, placed the peace prize in norwegian hands to save it from the grasp of nationalism. peace, he believed, must stand above power and pride.in his time, sweden and norway shared a crown but not a conscience; sweden was proud and militarized, norway smaller and more liberal. nobel, weary of nationalism and wary of swedish militarism, believed norwegians might judge peace with cleaner hands, unswayed by nationalism and political vanity.what began as a subtle rebuke of swedish militarism became a lasting symbol   that peace belongs not to the mighty, but to the impartial. by separating peace from power, he made oslo the world s conscience and ensured his final invention exploded not cities, but the boundaries of nationalism.a century later, awarding that prize to donald trump   a man who exalts nationalism over humanity, glorifies dominance, and treats diplomacy as mere transaction and spectacle   would, in a sad irony, invert nobel s intent and desecrate his vision.to honor trump would not only distort nobel s legacy; it would demonstrate that even the world s most valuable moral award is not immune to the politics of power, but instead dragged back into the very politics that the inventor of dynamite sought to transcend.nobel envisioned peace as humility in power and fraternity in difference. trump s diplomacy, shrewd yet self-serving, speaks another language   one of leverage, not reconciliation. in the end, oslo must remember: the nobel peace prize was meant for those who transcend borders, not for those who build them.analysisyou can share this story on social media:follow rt ondear readers! thank you for your vibrant engagement with our

undertaken followingsupreme courtdirections in april - tax officials also stumbled upon several transactions where the entire transaction was in cash.what has perplexed tax authorities is misreporting of data by sub-registrars in districts in bihar and up, prompting the department to raise the issue with top officials in the two states. the state govts have been asked to instruct sub-registrars to share data and follow due process while registering properties.in fact, within weeks of the top court order, the tax department had written to the registration directorate in the states.while sub-registrars were asked to share data, a verification done over last few months has shown widespread misreporting for the last three financial years. in fact, tax authorities also conducted spot verification in districts such as kishanganj, sitamarhi, araria and madhubani in bihar, where 250-300 instances were noticed with information on over rs 2 lakh cash transactions not being shared.besides, sub-registrars also failed to report property transactions of over rs 30 lakh mandated by law. for instance, officials said, over three years in one sub-registrar office in bihar, at least 600 transactions involving property deeds over rs 250 crore were not reported. similarly,pandetails were not captured and shared.the problem is not so acute in up, where officials have undertaken spot verification in districts such a maharajganj and pilibhit, among others. but there are a large number of defective entries, officials said, with prevalence of cash above rs 2 lakh seen, although on a smaller scale.over the last few years, the tax department has sought to crack down on cash transactions, especially in high value deals, and is collecting massive amounts of data to track those violating the law and crack down on black money.end of articlefollow us on social mediavideospm modi speaks to  friend  trump, discusses trade, congratulates him on gaza peace planpm modi, keir starmer hail india-uk ties, affirm partnership across trade, ai, defence, education'india should get rightful place in un security council': uk pm keir starmerindia flags khalistani threat to uk pm starmer, pm modi warns against misusing democratic freedomssresan pharma owner g ranganathan arrested in chennai over coldrif cough syrup deathsuk pm starmer lauds india's 'remarkable' growth months after trump's 'dead economy' jiberussian oil becomes cheaper, india plans higher imports despite donald trump's tariff pressureips officer 'suicide': wife seeks fir against haryana dgp, rohtak sp over 'harassment and abetment'india s fiery  dump truck  jibe at united nations: a scathing rebuttal to pak s kashmir propagandaindia on high alert as pakistan's terror groups adopt new tactics after operation sindoor debacle123photostoriessmart carbs for women in 40s: harvard-led study reveals key to healthy aging5 types of desi saag to consume in october3 signs in legs that may indicate poor blood circulation, and how to fix themaditi rao hydari sets the ramp ablaze as satya paul s new co-creative director8 famous food festivals in the world worth travelling for!radish leaves: 5 health benefits of these nutritious greens you probably didn t knowbollywood celebrity couples who will celebrate their first karwa chauth this year7 reasons owls are the masters of the nightfrom  dilwale dulhania le jayenge , hum dil de chuke sanam  to  baghban : when bollywood made karwa chauth a nationwide trendfive supplements that should be avoided with milk123hot picksnavi mumbai airportriyadh airbihar election dategold rate todaysilver rate todaypublic holidays octoberbank holidays octobertop trendingsaquon barkleyblake livelymike evanstaylor swifttyrone tracy jrstephen a smithstephen curryangel reesestephen a smithmaria sharapovatired of too many ads?go ad free nowtrending storiesin indiaentire websitei-t dept flags unreported cash property deals in bihar and up, asks sub-registrars to actpriya kapur behaving like 'cinderella's stepmom', karisma's children tell hcdelhi to uk: oppose illegal immigration, keen on legal mobilitybjp likely to finalise candidates in pm modi s presence on sundaytejashwi yadav s big poll pledge: a government job for every householdkarnataka approves 12 menstrual leaves a year across sectorsin talk with donald trump, pm modi hails success of gaza peace planfirozabad: railway over-bridge collapses; rescue operations under wayput  cap , minimise litigations, cabinet secretary t v somanathan instructs ministriesnc, pdp push rival land bills as gulmarg hotel leases expirebrittany mahomes turns heads in abercrombie & fitch nfl collection as randi mahomes proudly cheers her on'did not directly hit aircraft': putin admits russian missiles caused azerbaijan plane crash that killed 38; ukrainian drones were target i'm going to be alone raising these kids  -

    "text": "listen 1.0x+0:006:49listen to more stories on thenoaapp.l szl  krasznahorkai, who won the 2025 nobel prize in literature today, is not the easiest writer to read. his sentences can go on for hundreds of pages; his plots don t resolve, they dissolve; and his persistent mood is existential dread. but the hungarian novelist s central theme is easily parsed and sadly evergreen.krasznahorkaiwrites about the stultifying effects of political oppression, but he also writes in defiance of people s readiness to accept them. as a result, his work is equal parts depressing and invigorating. his landscapes are muddy and void, prone to sudden invasion by disturbing strangers, including the giant whale carcass that arrives on a train at the beginning of his 1989 novel,the melancholy of resistance.his never-ending sentences reflect the alienation of his characters, but they can also shake readers out of their torpor by propelling them forever forward, phrase into phrase, image into image.in past decades, the nobel prize committee has tended to prefer lucidity and clarity, in poetry as well as prose, over experimentation. though krasznahorkai s selection seems to bend this norm, it fits snugly into the committee s larger mission. the swedish institution often anoints writers who metabolize their specific histories into memorable language that stretches beyond borders and governments, transcending regional particulars. a laureate s work can often feel strangely placeless and timeless think oflouise gl ckorczes aw mi osz and affect us all the more deeply for its eschewal of concrete, historical fact.seamus heaney s sonnets about northern ireland in the 1970s andannie ernaux s memoirs of france in the 1960s propose indirect but approachable ways of engaging with personal and national history.krasznahorkai was born in hungary in 1954, two years before the soviets viciously crushed anuprising in budapest, and his first two novels are soaked through with an atmosphere of political terror. these novels were published before the revolutions of 1989, which would topple communism in the country. the rest of the author s work appeared afterward, although the first english translation wasn t published until 1998. krasznahorkai eventually found a global cult audience, who recognized his distinct ability to cloak anomie, violence, and resignation, smudged with a kind of gutter comedy, within a labyrinthine syntax.the historical setting of his novels might put off readers were it not for the peculiar magic of this style (to the immense credit of his skilledtranslators). these absorbing sentences, whose endless commas are a copy editor s nightmare, would seem to defy adaptation into film. and yet, like many others, i first encountered krasznahorkai not through his prose but through the films of another hungarian,b la tarr. these movies including the seven-hour-longs t ntang , a centerpiece of which is a shambling dance in a barroom often swap the meandering sentence for a single camera shot that lasts 10 minutes or more. the desolate roads and the mud puddles, the mangy dogs running down hills, the faces that have lost their color and their inclination for life altogether: these are the images from tarr and krasznahorkai that have stuck with me, along with characters whose eyes attest to  a combination of indifference and helpless resignation. read: the storyteller who offers no escapei ve lifted that phrase from the opening pages ofthe melancholy of resistance, krasznahorkai s greatest novel and the one you should start with. this book opens with a train that doesn t arrive; then it spirals out into an anatomy of social life under conditions of extreme dysfunction:all normal expectations went by the board and one s daily habits were disrupted by a sense of ever-spreading all-consuming chaos which rendered the future unpredictable, the past unrecallable and ordinary life so haphazard that people simply assumed that whatever could be imagined might come to pass, that if there were only one door in a building it would no longer open, that wheat would grow head downwards into the earth not out of it, and that, since one could only note the symptoms of disintegration, the reasons for it remaining unfathomable and inconceivable, there was nothing anyone could do except to get a tenacious grip on anything that was tangible  nothing in this paragraph reads as an explicit reference to politics in 1980s hungary. it might as well be set inviktor orb n s hungaryin 2025 or, for that matter,the united states under donald trump. the lightly surreal metaphors (downward growing wheat, a building with doors that don t open) are, in a state of political chaos, not surrealism at all, but something we might accurately describe as realism. in other words, much stranger things have happened, and they happen still, and before long, we might begin to take anything that happens as inevitable, and then as acceptable. what is a mutant stalk of wheat beside the warped facts of history, the once-unthinkable things that came to pass?in a 2025interview withthe yale review, krasznahorkai spoke about the russian invasion of ukraine. he was appalled:  a dirty, rotten war is unfolding before my eyes. the world is starting to get used to it. i cannot get used to it. i am incapable of accepting that people are killing people.  krasznahorkai s work throws an obstacle in front of our habituation to violence and war by showing us that what should be surreal or impossible has, in fact, become our reality. in its choice to honor his prophetic body of work, the nobel committee has broadcast a reminder that the political relevance of art lies, paradoxically, in its sense of feeling apart from time.  the apocalypse is a process that has been going on for a very long time and will continue for a very long time,  krasznahorkai said during theyalereviewinterview.  the apocalypse is now. the apocalypse is an ongoing judgment. about the authorwalt hunterfollowwalt hunteris a professor of english at case western reserve university. he is a contributing editor atthe atlantic, focusing on poetry.explore more topicsliterature,donald trump,hungary"

    "text": "photo: aaron schwartz/bloomberg/getty imagespresident donald trumpjust announced a deal that aims tobring an end to the brutal war between israel and hamas. if it holds, brokering the agreement that leads to a lasting cease-fire and the return of all israeli hostages could be one of the biggest accomplishments of his presidency.on the surface, this certainly sounded like the kind of thing that could win a president the nobel peace prize. and with the announcement of the 2025 prize set for friday morning, maga world got hyped   then gotfuriouswhen the award when to venezuelan opposition leadermar a corina machadoinstead.though he didn t win this year, a nobel peace prize for trump isn t totally out of the realm of possibility. the president has been openly and aggressively campaigning for the prize since his first term, which is unprecedented. his obvious desperation   paired with his foreign policy and authoritarian tendencies   may have actually hurt his chances with the nobel committee. on the other hand, it wouldn t be the first institution to bend to trump and there are diplomatic reasons to at least consider him.here s a guide, which we ll keep updated, to trump s long quest to win the nobel peace prize..what was trump s response to losing the 2025 nobel peace prize?he shared two self-aggrandizing truth social posts. in the first, he reposted a tweet in which machadosaid,  today more than ever we count on president trump :in the second, heposteda video of russian president vladimir putin praising his peace efforts, and complaining that the nobel peace prize sometimes goes to  undeserving  people:white house communications director steven cheung was the first trump administration official to weigh in on friday morning. he complained that the committee  proved they place politics over peace. the nobel committeesaidthey actually gave the award to machado because she is,  a tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. so cheung s explanation seems dubious. but it s good to know trump  will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives  even if there s nothing in it for him personally..how do we know trump wants the nobel peace prize?he s been insisting that he  deserves  the peace prize since since his first term, and he s only grown more fixated on it. he s mentioned the award publicly every few weeks since taking office again in january and often complains that he doesn t think he ll get it. here s typical lament, which hepostedto truth social in june:his obsession is so well known that he s gotten others to campaign on his behalf, as the washingtonpostreported:trump s quest to match an honor handed to then-president barack obama has been noted by lawmakers and world leaders eager to curry favor. several have nominated him for the prize. others, including trump s deputies and even a pharmaceutical company ceo, have publicly campaigned for his victory.trump has also resorted to behind-the-scenes lobbying:and trump, eager to boost his odds, phoned an influential norwegian friend, former nato secretary general jens stoltenberg, to float the topic as stoltenberg, now norway s finance minister, walked along an oslo street this summer, according to two officials familiar with the call..what is the prize for, specifically?nobel prizes were first awarded in 1901, five years after the death of alfred nobel. in his will, the swedish businessman said his sizable fortune should be used to establish prizes in the categories of physics, chemistry, medicine or physiology, literature, and peace.nobel s will said the peace prize should go  to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses, according tothe nobel website..who votes on the nobel peace prize?the prize is awarded by a committee of five people, who are appointed by the norwegian parliament. thecurrent membersof what is known as the norwegian nobel committee are j rgen watne frydnes (chair), asle toje (deputy chair), anne enger, kristin clemet, and gry larsen..was trump nominated in 2025?yes, he has received at least four nominations this year, as the miamiheraldsummarized:rep. darrell issa, a california republican, tapped him for the nobel peace prize.  not since ronald reagan has an american president better represented the national resolve of peace through strength or the fundamental case for a world without war,  the lawmaker said in a statement.a second lawmaker, rep. buddy carter, a georgia republican, followed suit months later. in a letter to the nobel committee, he singled out trump for his involvement in brokering a cease-fire between israel and iran, following their war.in june, the government of pakistan nominated trump for his work in brokering another cease-fire   this one between pakistan and india.  president trump s leadership during the 2025 pakistan india crisis manifestly showcases the continuation of his legacy of pragmatic diplomacy and effective peace-building,  the pakistani government wrote in a post on x.and, most recently, [israeli prime minister benjamin] netanyahu formally tapped trump for the prize. he announced the nomination   which he said was for trump s effort to bring peace to the middle east   during a white house visit in july, according to cnn.this sounds like an impressive number of nominations, until you learn that trump is just one of hundreds:  338 candidates nominated for the 2025 nobel peace prize, of which 244 are individuals and 94 are organisations, perthe nobel website.anyone can be put forward by the award by an eligible nominator, a group that includes government officials, college professors, and members of certain international organizations. (not so fun fact:adolf hitlerwas nominated in 1939!) the nobel committee does not identify the nominees for 50 years, but a nominator can publicly announce their submission. so it s possible that trump received more nominations, but only four were publicly announced..has he been nominated previously?yes, many times. his first two publicly disclosed nominations came in 2018 for his efforts to curtain north korea s nuclear program. according to theherald stally, trump has received at least 12 nominations over the years, including this year s submissions..could trump win for the israel-hamas deal?theoretically, he could win in 2026. confusingly, the washingtonpostreportedthat trump s desire for the prize may be part of the reason the white house pushed for a deal just before friday s nobel announcement:it may have helped spur hamas and israeli officials to strike a bargain this week, one former top israeli negotiator said, in hopes of being able to announce a buzzer-beating peace after two years of war so that trump can take home the gold.the  friday morning deadline is shaping the timeline, the announcement of the nobel committee in oslo,  col. doron hadar, a reservist officer who until last year commanded the israel defense forces  negotiation unit, said before trump announced a gaza ceasefire deal wednesday.  everyone understands this timeline, and that s why i believe that by [thursday] evening, there will already be a declaration that the sides have reached agreements. the norwegian nobel committee actually doesn t stay up all night on thursday, scanning the news and chugging red bull as they finalizing their pick. it s a careful, monthslong process, and the final selection is made days before the award is announced.following all the chatter about the israel-hamas deal potentially swinging things in trump s favor, the committee announced that this year s winner was locked in on monday. the last meeting of the nobel committee took place on monday,  spokesman erik aasheimtoldafp..so howdoesthe nobel committee select the winner?this is not some shadowy or haphazard process: it s all spelled out on the nobelwebsite, which includes a photo of the current committee in the statelyroom in which they deliberate:the norwegian nobel committee, 2025. from left: anne enger, kristian berg harpviken (secretary), gry larsen, kristin clemet, asle toje (vice-chair), and j rgen watne frydnes (chair).   nobel prize outreach. photo: geir anders rybakken  rslien.photo: geir anders rybakken  rslien/nobel prize outreachfebruary 1 is the deadline for submissions. from february to march the committee reviews submissions and prepares a shortlist. this typically whittles the list to 20 to 30 candidates, who are then given closer examination:the candidates on the short list are then considered by the nobel institute s permanent advisers. in addition to the institute s director and research director, the body of advisers generally consists of a small group of norwegian university professors with broad expertise in subject areas with a bearing on the peace prize. the advisers usually have a couple of months in which to draw up their reports. reports are also occasionally requested from other norwegian and foreign experts.when the advisers  reports have been presented, the nobel committee embarks on a thorough-going discussion of the most likely candidates. in the process, the need often arises to obtain additional information and updates about candidates from additional experts, often foreign.there is no decision until the final meeting before the announcement. the committee  seeks to achieve unanimity in its selection of the nobel peace prize laureate,  but if they can t reach a consensus the winner is determined by a simple majority vote..what did obama get the nobel peace prize for?basically for not being george w. bush. obama was awarded the prize in 2009 after he d been in power for less than eight months. the nobel committeepraisedhim for his commitment to a world free from nuclear weapons and  extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples. this is still seen as one of the nobel committee s more questionable decisions. obama himself said he thought it should have gone to someone else in his initial statement on the honor. to be honest, i do not feel that i deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who have been honored by this prize, men and women who ve inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace,  he said..are there any signs that the nobel committee is warming to trump?no. the backlash to obama s win may have made the norwegian nobel committee even more hesitant to make a controversial pick. the committee s former secretary geir lundestad latersaidthat the decision to award obama  didn t achieve what [the committee] had hoped for. it s widely believed that nobel voters will be turned off by trump s open campaigning. and three of the five voting members have publicly criticized him for other reasons, as the washingtonpostreportedin august:the chairman of the norwegian nobel committee, jorgen watne frydnes, in december decried  the erosion of freedom of expression even in democratic nations,  calling out trump by name. trump launched more than 100 verbal attacks on the media during his election campaign,  said frydnes, 40, who has also served as the head of pen norway, a group that promotes freedom of expression.   after just over 100 days as president, [trump] is well underway in dismantling american democracy, and he is doing everything he can to tear down the liberal and rules-based world order, wrote kristin clemet, a former center-right norwegian education minister and another of the five committee members, in may.a third member of the committee   and thus potentially the lock on a trump-skeptic majority   posted several messages critical of the president during his first term. in a photo on facebook posted the day before the 2020 election, the committee member, gry larsen, was wearing a red  make human rights great again  baseball hat.larsen, a former center-left politician, also wrote in a 2017 twitter post that  trump is putting millions of lives at risk,  criticizing a decision to reduce u.s. foreign aid.the other two committee members don t have a clear history of criticizing trump. one of them, academic asle toje, wrote sympathetically about trump s legal travails during the biden administration.the two other committee members have not publicly criticized trump, and  one of them, academic asle toje, wrote sympathetically about trump s legal travails during the biden administration. when asked about trump s pressure campaign hours after the 2025 prize went to machado, norweigen nobel committee chair j rgen watne frydnes essentially said trump didn t get the prize because he lacks  courage and integrity :.should trump win the nobel peace prize?maybe! and not just for the reasons he and his cronies have claimed. jonathan chaitnotedinthe atlanticthat trump s desperation actually appears to be inspiring him to make better foreign-policy decisions:to be sure, trump s desperate thirst to win this prize is of a piece with his general insatiable need to be flattered and praised a desire that spurs plenty of bad choices, such as pushing to have anybody who opposes him thrown into prison. but in this case, it can be credited with inspiring his most constructive, prosocial impulses as president.on the other hand, chait argues, trump will have little motivation to  be good  once he wins the award:the challenge the prize committee faces is that if dangling the award in front of trump encourages him to work hard to end conflicts, and perhaps to not start new ones, then they have to wonder what will happen if he gets it. once given, these awards can t be revoked. a trump who has secured his nobel peace prize might feel tempted to go after the ego gratifications that come with military conquest.so we re in a ridiculous situation in which presenting to give the president the nobel peace prize, even if he doesn t actually deserve it, might be the surest path to actually achieving a more peaceful world.this piece was updated after the 2025 nobel peace prize winner was announced.more on politicsthe white house lied about destroying the white housetrump says demolished white house east wing was ugly anywaytrump s white house ballroom: plans, cost, and who s really

    "text": "ronan, mont., oct. 09, 2025 (globe newswire) -- airjoule technologies corporation (nasdaq: airj) ( airjoule technologies  or the  company ), a leading technology platform that unleashes the power of water from air, congratulates susumu kitagawa, richard robson, and omar yaghi on their receipt of the 2025 nobel prize in chemistry for developing metal-organic frameworks (\"mofs\"). this prestigious recognition underscores the transformative potential of mof technology and validates the company's mission to bring these groundbreaking materials to commercial scale.metal-organic frameworks are crystalline materials with nanoscale pores capable of capturing, storing, and releasing molecules with exceptional selectivity. since their discovery, mofs have shown vast potential across applications including water harvesting, carbon capture,gas storage, and chemical separations. their ability to perform complex molecular tasks with precision places them at the center of next-generation sustainability technologies.despite their extraordinary promise, mof technology has faced significant barriers to commercialization. the high manufacturing costs of mof materials, combined with challenges in scaling production processes and integrating mofs into practical systems, have limited their real-world deployment. for decades, mof technology remained largely confined to research laboratories and small-scale applications.airjoule technologies has addressed this commercialization challenge through strategic innovation and partnerships. working closely with basf, a global leader in chemical manufacturing, airjoule technologies has substantially reduced the production cost of promising mof materials at scale, making the technology economically viable for widespread deployment. the company's proprietary airjoule platform combines these cost-effective mofs with a dual vacuum chamber design to efficiently extract pure distilled water directly from the atmosphere and provide a sustainable solution to water scarcity challenges around the world.\"this nobel prize recognition is a well-deserved validation of mof technology and opens the door to applications that will help solve some of the world s most pressing needs such as water security and energy-efficient air conditioning,\" said dr. pete mcgrail, co-inventor of the airjoule platform. \"what makes this moment particularly significant is that we're no longer limited to laboratory demonstrations. by solving the cost and scalability challenges that have historically hindered mof commercialization, we're now deploying this technology through the airjoule platform in real-world applications that can positively impact millions of people. airjoule technologies is leading the commercialization of mofs through its joint venture with ge vernova, with the harvesting of water from air serving as the initial high-impact application. the company s near-term target markets include industrial scale users of water, including data centers and manufacturing operations, along with the us military. airjoule systems are currently operating in texas and the united arab emirates, with additional deployments planned for q4 2025 and early 2026.\"the recognition of mof research by the nobel committee for chemistry reflects the scientific community's confidence in this technology's future impact to the world,\" said dr. david moore, executive manager at the ge vernova advanced research center. \"ge vernova s collaboration with professor omar yaghi as part of the darpa air2water program was rooted in advancing his pioneering mof research for atmospheric water extraction, and it was instrumental in spawning our joint venture with airjoule technologies. today, through our joint venture with airjoule technologies, we are commercializing these breakthrough mof materials at scale in practical, deployable systems that address real-world challenges in water scarcity and resource sustainability. this moment validates not only the fundamental science but also the commercial viability of mof technology that we've worked together to achieve.\"about airjoule

    "text": "most recent postnorway is bracing for donald trump s reaction should he not be awarded the nobel peace prize.norway simply hosts the prestigious award ceremony its government has no involvement in deciding who wins. but with hours on the clock before the nobel peace prize recipient is named, norway s politicians are sweating that trump may not know the difference.kirsti bergst , the leader of norway s socialist left party, toldthe guardianthat oslo must be  prepared for anything.  donald trump is taking the u.s. in an extreme direction, attacking freedom of speech, having masked secret police kidnapping people in broad daylight and cracking down on institutions and the courts. when the president is this volatile and authoritarian, of course we have to be prepared for anything,  bergst  told the international newspaper. the nobel committee is an independent body and the norwegian government has no involvement in determining the prizes,  she continued.  but i m not sure trump knows that. we have to be prepared for anything from him. the nobel prize committee announced thursday that it had decided the prize winner at the beginning of the week, before the trump administration brokered a ceasefire arrangement between israel and gaza. timeframe considered,  most nobel experts and norwegian observers believe it is highly unlikely that trump will be awarded the prize, the guardianreported.it s no secret that trump has pined for the international honor: the u.s. presidentphonednorway s finance minister jens stoltenberg  out of the blue  back in july to inquire about the possibility of acquiring the prize, using tariffs as a cover for their discussion.trump has complained for years that his name has not yet been added to the ranks of prize recipients, who span some of the greatest figures of the last century, including nelson mandela, martin luther king jr., mother theresa, and malala yousafzai.part of the contention could be that trump s supposed political nemesis, former president barack obama, received the award in 2009 for  extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.  three other u.s. presidents have also won a nobel peace prize. they gave it to obama for absolutely destroying our country,  trump said, during an oval office meeting with finnish president alexander stubb thursday.  my election was much more important. trump s obsession with obtaining the prize has led to some odd boasts over the last several months, including that he has resolved eight wars around the globe in his second term alone. trump has so far claimed responsibility for peace between the democratic republic of the congo and the republic of rwanda, between cambodia and thailand, between israel and iran, between india and pakistan, between serbia and kosovo, between egypt and ethiopia, between armenia and azerbaijan, and for  doing the abraham accords,  all while complaining about a lack of recognition by the norway-based judges  panel.aszeteo s mehdi hasanpointed out last month, all of trump s war-solving braggadocio is  demonstrably untrue,  to the extent that several of the listed examples were never even at war. nobody in history has solved eight wars in a period of nine months. and i ve stopped eight wars, so that s never happened before. but they ll have to do what they do. whatever they do is fine. i know this: i didn t do it for that, i did it because i saved a lot of lives,  trump said thursday while answering a barrage of questions about the prize.  but nobody s done eight wars. share this storyread more about trump:trump s nobel peace prize obsession is getting way out of handmost recent postpresident trump s gaza ceasefire deal seems to be more geared toward preparing the region to be his  riviera of the middle east  than offering self-determination to palestinians. can you promise palestinians they will be able to stay?  a reporter asked trump at his thursday cabinet meeting, just a day after he announced the ceasefire deal. well, they know exactly what we re doing. we re gonna create something where people can live, you can t live right now in gaza,  trumpreplied.  it s a horrible situation, nobody has ever seen anything like it. so yeah, we re gonna create better conditions for people. q: can you promise palestinians they will be able to stay?trump: uhhh. well they know exactly what we're doing. you can't live right now in gaza.pic.twitter.com/imz909ndup  aaron rupar (@atrupar)october 9, 2025a deal that forces palestinians out of their homes and puts redevelopment into the hands of the u.s., israel, and tony blair isn t a deal it s ethnic cleansing. this deal is also contingent upon israel lifting the aid blockade and ending its genocidal attacks once the hostages are returned, but even that is not a guarantee. looking ahead, what guarantees hamas disarms, and that israel doesn t resume bombing once the hostages are released?  another reporter asked. well the first thing we re doing is getting our hostages back, ok? and that s what people wanted more than anything else, they wanted these hostages back that have lived in hell like nobody has ever even dreamt possible,  trump said.  after that, we ll see. but they ve agreed to things, and i think it s gonna move along pretty well. israel  agreed to things  in the short-lived ceasefire of november 2023, which it broke on the very first day when the idfopened fireon gazans returning to their homes. when asked how this time would be any different, all the president could say was,  we ll see. share this storymost recent posthealth secretary robert f. kennedy jr., who has drawn widespread criticism for manipulating science to fit his agenda, admitted

meeting because, he said, he d been disturbed by a social media video:  somebody showed me a tiktok video of a pregnant woman at eight months pregnant she s an associate professor at the columbia medical school and she is saying  f trump  and gobbling tylenol with her baby in her placenta,  he recalled. it is not immediately clear what video he was referring to, and babies are not in the placenta, but attached to it, in pregnancy.the health secretary went on to cite a number of studies that allegedly support his tylenol suspicions. then he made an eyebrow-raising statement about the existing evidence:  it is not proof,  kennedy said.  we re doing the studies tomake the proof. rfk jr on tylenol and autism: \"it is not proof. we're doing the studies to make the proof.\"pic.twitter.com/57h9bjnyol  aaron rupar (@atrupar)october 9, 2025according to theamerican academy of pediatricsand american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, it is safe for women to use acetaminophen occasionally  as directed for fever and pain relief during pregnancy,  and patients should talk with their obstetrician about pain relief, as with all medications, during pregnancy.rfk jr. s stated plan to invent evidence to back up his controversial claim to the contrary has already drawn ridicule online.  ah yes, wrotedr. michelle au, a physician, public health advocate, and democratic state legislator in georgia,  the scientific method famously instructs us to predetermine a conclusion and then do studies to  make the proof.  but  make the proof  is a fitting credo for a man reshaping the public health system as kennedy is now. the health secretary in june dismissed the cdc s entire advisory committee on immunization practices; installed his own hand-picked members, including vaccine skeptics; and fired susan monarez, the former director of the cdc, for refusing to  commit in advance to approving every acip recommendation, regardless of the

thursday, noem excoriated portland mayor keith wilson, oregon governor tina kotek, and portland police chief bob day, after her surprise visit to a u.s. immigration and customs enforcement facility in the south portland neighborhood earlier this week. i   met with the governor, met with the mayor, met with the chief of police, and the superintendent of the highway patrol. they re all lying, and disingenuous, and dishonest people,  she said.  because as soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response. so, we re looking at new facilities to purchase there in portland too. and we re gonna double down. and i told them if they didn t meet our demands for safety and security on the streets then we re going to bring in more federal law enforcement,  she added.but noem s trip tuesday revealed that portland isn t the war zone the president claims.local officials have continued to undermine the trump administration s outlandish claims about portland. kotek, who got wind of noem s visit,reportedlymet her at the airport, where the governor said she  reiterated again that there is no insurrection in oregon. outside the facility noem visited, there were no hardened terrorists,only a handful of reporters and a guy in a chicken costume. by midday, there were about two dozen protesters, but they were still outnumbered by reporters, according tooregon live. and across the city, organizersthrew a puppy paradeto tell ice to get its paws off portland. still, appearing on fox news later, noemcalledlocal leaders  a bunch of pansies  and said she wanted even more security at the ice facility.wilsonsaidthat the quiet day noem witnessed was proof that  portland continues to manage public safety professionally and responsibly, irrespective of the claims of out-of-state social media influencers. it seems that noem now hopes to punish portland officials for their repeated assertions that they were doing a fine job of managing public safety on their own.on wednesday, during a roundtable of right-wing influencers talking about anti-fascist resistance to the president, noemaccusedwilson and kotek of  covering up the terrorism that is hitting their streets. noem also claimed that portland police officers were  cheering  on protesters that were saying slogans such as  kill ice agents  and  molotov cocktails melt ice. day told kgw8 that noem s claim was an  abhorrent allegation.  since the secretary had several people documenting her movements, we urge her to provide video evidence to support this claim,  he said.  such inflammatory rhetoric undermines trust and distracts from our goal to ensure safety in the south waterfront area. our officers remain professional, dedicated, and committed to serving the people of portland with

so far, the shutdown has furloughed more than half a million federal employees, according to anew york timesmonitor. that includes 89 percent of the environmental protection agency, 87 percent of the education department, and 71 percent of the department of housing and urban development. forty-five percent of the civilian workforce of the defense department has also been temporarily let

maga republican, criticized republican house speaker mike johnson on thursday for delaying the swearing-in of representative-elect adelita grijalva, an arizona democrat.amid the ongoing government shutdown, johnson has cancelled regular house sessions and held off on swearing in grijalva who was elected more than two weeks ago during the brief pro forma sessions taking place in the meantime.but since johnson previously swore in gop representatives during pro formas, democrats are accusing the speaker of dragging his feet due to grijalva s stance on releasing all unclassified documents related to jeffrey epstein. the arizona democrat would provide the deciding, 218th signature on a petition to force a house vote on the epstein files  release.johnson denies that the petition currently signed by 213 democrats, as well as greene and three fellow republicans has anything to do with his reluctance vis- -vis grijalva. i can t conclusively say if that s why the house is not in session, but the house should be in session,  greenetoldcnn on thursday.  and the house should be in session for many reasons. we have appropriation bills that need to get passed. there is a new democrat that s been elected that does deserve to be sworn in. her district elected her. we have other bills that we need to be passing. if johnson is indeed just hoping to avoid the discharge petition, greene said,  why drag this out? that is going to have 218 signatures, and i say go ahead and do it, and get it over with. the georgia republican has proven very willing of late to defy herparty sleadership. also during her cnn interview, for example, greenesaidjohnson and the republican senate majority leader john thune  absolutely  deserve the blame for the shutdown.  we control

shutting down as a result of president donald trump s behemoth budget reconciliation bill.during an interview on msnbc smorning joethursday, nebraska representative mike flood didn t deny co-host joe scarborough, who told him that six rural hospitals would likely shutter as a result of the massive cuts to medicaid he voted for. in fact, flood didn t seem the least bit concerned.flood claimed that the senate s supplementary$50 billion fundfor a rural health transformation program would offset some of the squeeze, but admitted that many rural hospitals would need to prepare to be stripped of essential services. here s the deal: some hospitals in america, that are rural hospitals, are going to eventually have to transition from being acute bed hospitals into, like, an emergency room model,  floodsaid.the senate s $50 billion fund which islittle over one thirdof the estimated loss in federal funding to rural hospitals -would force hospitals to  think creatively about what kind of services we need in really small towns,  flood explained.but it s still unclear how exactly the money would be distributed, according tokff. the law did not offer specific criteria that the centers for medicare and medicaid services would use to approve or deny applications for funding, rules about how cash would be allocated, or language requiring transparency about how the decisions are made. one can easily imagine that if the decision is in the hands of trump, who has already moved togutprograms in blue states, total compliance with his agenda would be necessary to receive support.trump s behemoth budget bill will cut nearly one trillion from medicaid funding over the next 10 years, resulting in the mass closure of rural hospitals, which are already struggling to survive.because more people receive and rely on medicaid coverage in rural communities than in urban areas, cuts to medicaid would force rural hospitals, which already operate on razor thin margins, to absorb skyrocketing rates of uncompensated care, according to thenational rural health association. the continued strain will force them to cut services and personnel, and eventually close. more than 45 percent of rural hospitals in the united states operate with negative margins, andmore than 300 rural hospitalsare at risk of closing as a result of trump s  one big, beautiful bill. and nebraska, flood s home state, is no exception. thenebraska rural health associationfound that 39 of the state s 71 rural hospitals have a two percent or less operating margin. of those hospitals, 29 had negative operating margins in 2018, and 22 of them had a -3 percent margin or less.the university of nebraska medical center s college of public health published areportin may that found that cuts to medicaid would cost 110,000 nebraskans their health insurance and put 5,000 nebraskans out of their jobs.but when asked whether the medicaid cuts would hurt rural hospitals, flood claimed that his state was on an  upward trend  in terms of health care access.  we do have resources here, and our hospitals and doctors are providing great care. i wouldn t be saying this if i didn t live it. i live it, i live in it, i love it,  he said.but it s not whether the high quality care already exists, but how long it will be accessible that is concerning health care experts and constituents.share this storyread more about hospitals:the republicans  medicaid cuts could cause a rural unemployment crisismost recent postrepresentative marjorie taylor greene is exhausted with republican leadership as they fluster and flounder the government shutdown.so far, the government has been shut down for more than eight days the result of a boiling disagreement between democrats and republicans, left over from the spring, about how to fund donald trump s  big, beautiful  budget.republicans want to pass a  clean  continuing resolution, which would provide the executive branch with unfettered funds to advance the president s agenda as outlined in his july legislation. that would include ruinous cuts to obamacare subsidies and medicaid, a position that democrats have demonstrated for months is a nonstarter.in the eight days since discussions broke down, conservatives have overwhelmingly blamed democrats for the federal failure. but in an interview withthe atlanta journal-constitutionthursday, one of the party s most far-right figures argued that republicans  blame game won t get them very far with the american public especially as the gop clutches every branch of the federal government. there s a lot of things we can be working on in the house, and that s our appropriation bills. there s many other bills we could be passing right now,  greene said on the paper s podcastpolitically georgia. i don t think it s believable to tell the american people that while we control the white house, the house, and the senate, that we can t return to work in washington, d.c., because chuck schumer and six other democrats won t vote to open the government,  greene continued.  i know people. they don t believe that. house speaker mike johnson canceled chamber votes and sent lawmakers home earlier this month as party leadership works to negotiate with democrats, but the decision hasn t gone down well with members of his caucus. i m against the [continuing resolution] and i m for appropriations,  greene said.  i really don t see how we ll ever pass the appropriations if we continue to sit at home and then we have another deadline coming on november 20. beyond that, republicans have failed to align their messaging on the shutdown, making for amessy public spectacle. johnson and senate majority leader john thune have repeatedly flubbed attempts to coordinate their priorities with the white house, which has so far been more absorbed inpunishing trump s political alliesthan in coming to a congressional resolution.still, none of greene s criticism was directed at trump. reacting in a separate interview to awashington postpollthat found that the majority of americans believed that trump and republicans in congress were at fault for the shutdown, greene said that she wouldn t put the  blame on the president.  i m actually putting the blame on the speaker and leader thune in the senate,  greene toldcnnthursday.  this should not be happening. as a member of congress, we already have a low enough job approval rating. this shutdown is just going to drive everybody s approval rating that much lower. the georgia lawmaker has somewhat divorced herself from the maga brand in recent months.greene, who won her district in 2020 without the president s endorsement, haspublicly brokenwith trump several times since his inauguration. she s differed from her  favorite president  on issues ranging from artificial intelligence to russia s assault on ukraine, and has also sparred with the white house over the executive branch s apparent hostility toward demands to release the epstein files. now she appears to vehemently disagree with trump s position on the shutdown, which has thus far involved a blame campaign that legal experts argue is in violation of the hatch

depended on apks to sideload apps unavailable on the play store, from older game versions to niche tools and classic emulators. but under the upcoming system, sideloading from unverified sources will either trigger warnings or face outright installation blocks, as per a report by press gt.the change will also hit open-source rom projects like lineageos and third-party emulators that rely on system-level permissions. for android users who cherish the freedom to customize, modify, and experiment with their devices, this is a major blow.why is google making this move?google defends its decision as a necessary step toward improved security and transparency. the company s 2024 android ecosystem security report revealed that sideloaded apks are more than 50 times likelier to contain malware compared to play store apps. many of these malicious apks disguise themselves as emulators or modified games, secretly stealing user data or mining cryptocurrency in the background, as per a report by press gt.also read :here are the lyrics of zach bryan song that irked trump and kristi noem as democrats come out in full supportto counter this, google introduced its developer verification program, which requires developers to prove their identity with government id, verified business details, and registered payment credentials. only verified developers will be permitted to distribute apps that can be sideloaded or installed through third-party stores.while google maintains that this isn t a total ban on sideloading, critics say the impact will feel the same   especially for small developers, modders, and emulator creators who lack corporate backing or the means to navigate google s new framework, as per a report by press gt.how will apks, roms, and emulators be affected?for millions of android users, apks have long symbolized freedom, the ability to install anything, anytime. roms allowed users to revive older phones, while emulators brought beloved retro games from consoles like playstation, nintendo, and game boy straight to mobile devices.but under google s updated policy, this freedom could vanish. custom rom developers, including those behind lineageos and pixel experience, now fear losing access to essential google mobile services (gms) certification, which is required to run apps such as gmail, youtube, and the play store, as per a report by press gt.also read: trump in panic mode as his maga queen distances herself from him - who is she and why it matterswithout certification, users could be forced to choose between staying on uncertified

crackdown could classify emulation as a  gray area  under digital rights management (drm). while google hasn t confirmed bans on emulators directly, the inclusion of  rom-based systems and software that replicate proprietary environments  in its upcoming 2025 play protect update has raised red flags across the development community.is android losing its identity?for over a decade, android s biggest selling point has been its openness, a direct contrast to apple s tightly controlled ios ecosystem. but critics now warn that google s latest policy erodes that distinction.tech analyst arjun

apks outside google s control. some are even considering fully independent android forks, versions of the os that don t rely on google play services, in a bid to preserve android s original spirit, as per a report by press gt.what should users expect by 2026?here s what android users should prepare for as these rules phase in:unverified apks will trigger play protect warnings or fail to install

long-term implications could reshape android s foundation. users who built their experience around modding, emulation, or third-party apps may need to rethink how they interact with the platform.what does this mean for android s future?google insists its changes will make android safer. but to many users, it feels like the company is closing the very gates that made android unique. the balance between security and freedom has always defined the platform, now, it seems that balance is shifting toward control.for millions of developers and fans, android s  wild west  era, where anything could

(quran 2:11)nothing says peace like two years of starvation, bombardment and mass graves, when, instead of delivering food, they delivered shrouds.and while gaza bled, the powerful perfected the art of denial. and when i see the people of gaza celebrating in the streets, i know that this celebration belongs to them alone, not to donald trump, who has announced he will visit the region to take credit for what he calls a  historic occasion , and not to western leaders who profited from gaza s devastation while pretending neutrality. the people rushing to cameras to claim credit are the same ones who made the genocide possible, who funded it with billions in military aid, armed it with precision-guided missiles and provided diplomatic cover at the united nations while repeatedly vetoing un security council ceasefire resolutions. the united states approved an additional $14.3bn in military aid during the genocide, bypassing congressional oversight multiple times to rush apache helicopter missiles, 155mm artillery shells, night-vision equipment and bunker-busting bombs that landed on the heads of families as they slept.those of us sitting in the comfort of the west should feel shame. americans like to imagine themselves on the right side of history. we tell ourselves that had we lived during jim crow or the holocaust, we would have done anything to stop it. but we have 340 million people in america, and we could not stop our tax dollars from funding extermination. we could not even deliver baby formula, as we watched babies  bodies waste away. many sat in complicity, made excuses for the inexcusable, blamed palestinians for their own deaths, and turned away from the horror because acknowledging it would have meant confronting our own government s role in funding it. our failure did not eclipse palestinian agency; it made it more visible.advertisementthe only pressure that mattered came from the people israel could not silence, palestinians who livestreamed their own deaths so the world could not claim ignorance or accept israel s falsehoods as truth. gaza survived because of its own resistance, a resistance to which its people are entitled. the ceasefire came because palestinian steadfastness broke something the bombs could not touch, because the facade of israeli victimhood crumbled under the weight of livestreamed atrocity, and because global public opinion turned against israel despite every effort to manufacture consent for genocide. what it accomplished is written in civilian death rolls, not in security. that is what forced this ceasefire.palestine s most celebrated poet, mahmoud darwish, knew how this would go:  the war will end. the leaders will shake hands. the old woman will keep waiting for her martyred son. that girl will wait for her beloved husband. and those children will wait for their heroic father. i don t know who sold our homeland. but i saw who paid the price.  now they broker peace between the killer and the killed, the butcher and the slain, and call it progress. the price was paid in palestinian blood. and somewhere, an old woman, a new bride or an orphaned daughter is still waiting for their loved ones to come home.there must be full accountability, not just for israel but for every government and corporation that made this genocide possible. there must be a comprehensive arms embargo on israel immediately, economic sanctions until there is complete withdrawal from occupied territory, freedom for the more than 10,000 palestinian hostages, and reparations for reconstruction determined and distributed by palestinians themselves. war criminals must be prosecuted at the hague, regardless of which nation objects. this is just the start. justice is not a diplomatic option; it is the minimum measure of our shared humanity.the  peace  trump s plan promises died with every child in gaza, every displaced family, and every day the world called genocide  self-defence , ignoring the international court of justice s 2004 ruling that an occupier cannot claim self-defence against the occupied.the only just future is complete liberation   one democratic state with equal rights for all, beginning with gaza s right to determine its own fate without siege, without occupation and without foreign control disguised as peacekeeping. but first, the people of gaza have earned the right to mourn, to count their dead and bury them properly, and above all, to feel this small moment of joy. palestinians have earned, through unimaginable suffering, the right to define what freedom looks like. the rest of the world has no standing to tell them otherwise.for those of us in the west, we must make sure that the world does not return to normal. we cannot be lulled back to sleep by the temporary cessation of air strikes while the occupation continues. israel cannot continue as if it did not commit the gravest crime of our generation. the hundreds of thousands of martyred and maimed palestinians demand justice that cannot be denied.advertisementwe cannot rest until the entire system of occupation and apartheid is dismantled and replaced with liberation. this is only the beginning. free palestine, from the river to the sea.the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect al jazeera s editorial stance."

court cases filed to prevent unnecessary litigation and resource wastage. following a meeting with pm modi, secretaries are tasked with analysing judgments to minimize future legal disputes. this initiative aims to reduce costs and improve efficiency across government operations.new delhi: ministries and departments have been directed to put a \"ceiling\" on the number of court cases that can be filed, in an effort to avoid unnecessary litigations and avoid wastage of public resources.following a meeting earlier this week between pm narendra modi and all departmental secretaries, cabinet secretary t v somanathan on thursday sent a communication outlining several action points, including the need to analyse court judgments to identify ways to minimise litigation.as on march 18 this year, 53 ministries and departments are a party in around 7.27 lakh cases across various courts and tribunals, as per a government reply in lok sabha.sources said that, to discourage ministries and departments from engaging in avoidable or unnecessary legal proceedings-often at significant cost to the public exchequer-secretaries have been instructed to ensure that cases are filed only after careful consideration and thorough analysis of similar past cases. departments have also been advised to create a pool of academically outstanding final-year law students, who can assist with legal research, drafting, and other aspects of litigation.officials said that the pm urged all department heads to reduce litigations and also to draft legislations in easy to understand and simple language for convenience of citizens. the meeting had lasted for more than two hours where different secretaries had made their observations and suggestion.toi has learnt that taking forward his swadeshi pitch and to reduce imports, modi asked secretaries to interact with domestic manufacturers to identify products that can be produced domestically and that the departments should handhold those industries to facilitate efficient manufacturing of the identified products locally.they have also been asked to explore the possibility of having panels of accredited third party assessors and auditors under quality council of india for certifying the quality of products and processes to promote trust and quality.they have been asked to see that these arrangements align with international norms for accreditation.the pm has also asked departments to encourage researchers and manufacturers in defence sector to use their technologies for commercial manufacturing of products for civilian use and to promote ecosystem for indigenous development of public digital and social media platforms.the pm has also asked the ministries and departments to have a \"whole of government\" approach in implementing initiatives, policies and schemes which involve participation of multiple departments, meaning that departments should not focus on their narrow area of work but look at the larger national perspective.end of articlefollow us on social mediavideospm modi speaks to  friend  trump, discusses trade, congratulates him on gaza peace planpm modi, keir starmer hail india-uk ties,

meeting.modi and trump had last spoken on sept 16, when the us president called the pm to wish him on his birthday and praised him for doing a \"tremendous job\". since the announcement of trump's

forward.earlier in the day, modi joined uk pm keir starmer in expressing support for the us peace plan for gaza and their commitment to working with regional partners to secure an immediate and

(photo by mitterbauer/ullstein bild via getty images)ullstein bild via getty imagesafter nasa unveiled its fascinating findings of possible life that emerged on mars when its dunes spread out alongside rivers that channeled into lakes formed inside massive impact craters, i asked dr. worden whether, if the working hypothesis of primitive life on mars is confirmed, that would represent one of the most world-changing revelations in the history of human civilization, on a level with copernicus toppling the greek astronomer ptolemy s model of the earth as the center of the cosmos.if the earth loses its position as the sole eden in the endless starry skies, could that also mean there might be life across billions of planets in the milky way or trillions of planets across the universe? there are two possibilities for life,  dr. worden says in a fascinating sketch he sent to me on the alternative potential origins of life on mars, and on earth. the first is that it arises in chemical processes on or near planetary surfaces. if we find life on mars or elsewhere in the solar system that s truly different (chemically even structurally) that would mean life may be everywhere.  conversely,  he adds,  life (on earth or mars), could have arisen elsewhere and been transported via meteorites.  this is called panspermia.  a variant is  directed panspermia  where the life was deliberately planted.  if life is similar, especially if mars and earth life show a common ancestor that may mean life originated on the earth (or mars) and traveled between planets.  a variant is that the galaxy is infected with life and life on earth or mars came from an interstellar source, (including a deliberate intelligent one),  worden says. this is most interesting as its would indicate at least our galaxy could be teeming with life.  there are several reasons to prefer this answer. no matter which theory on the fountainhead of life in this solar system ultimately turns out to be the correct one, he adds, solid scientific proof that life had once taken hold on mars, and might still survive across scattered refugia, would be one of the greatest breakthroughs ever made by humanity in modeling the universe, and would provide powerful boosters to the global quest to foster a spacefaring civilization.already an academic star in the sphere of astrophysics and in the search for advanced alien civilizations, pete worden also gained screen fame with his part in the hbo s sensational new documentarywild wild space.the show, now beingstreamed by hbo max, skips across a montage of independent space players like the future co-founders of planet labs, who tested their first prototypes of miniaturized imaging satellites while enlisted in worden s brigades of young freethinking space scientists and inventors when he headed the nasa ames research center.the leaders of planet labs, the leading-edge designer of imagery satellites, launched their first prototype while still

transformed the nasa outpost, located in the wild west tech capital of silicon valley, into a futuristic skunkworks of radical spaceflight experiments.just as he reshaped nasa ames into the central node in a globe-spanning network connecting space visionaries and newspace rocket designers, at the breakthrough foundation he has crafted a worldwide web of exchanges with the top scientists seeking outinterstellar cultures and astronomersthat might be beaming laser-borne messages across the milky way.across a decade-long series of breakthrough discuss assemblies, which have skipped from the campus of stanford university in california to the university of oxford in the uk, worden has invited leading lights to brainstorm on new ideas and innovations to push forward this celestial quest.the expanding search for extraterrestrial intelligence has gained a global spotlight through blockbuster films like 'contact' by robert zebecks (photo by francois duhamel/sygma via getty images)sygma via getty imagesmeanwhile, dr. worden elaborated on his conception,  life in the universe,  in a follow-up missive via electronic mail: it is now widely accepted that life emerged on earth over four billion years ago,  he says. remarkably, life appears to have begun within a few hundred million years after the planet cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of liquid water   a necessary condition for all known earth-based life.  we know a great deal about thelast universal common ancestor(luca)   the hypothetical root organism from which all current life on earth descends.  luca already possessed a sophisticated molecular toolkit, including the dna-to-rna-to-protein translation machinery.  but beyond luca, our knowledge fades into speculation.  most biologists hypothesize that luca was preceded by anrna world, in which early life was based solely on rna   a molecule that can store genetic information and catalyze chemical reactions.  dna, the more stable information-storage molecule, likely evolved later,  worden says. although the rna world hypothesis is widely discussed,direct evidence is lacking, and current examples of rna-based organisms are limited to certain viruses.  asnobel laureate gary ruvkunobserved: luca, the last universal common ancestor of all life on earth, already had the full suite of dna-to-rna-to-protein machinery, including the ribosome, trnas, polymerases.  that s an incredibly complex system. it seems unlikely that all that evolved on earth in the few hundred million years between planetary cooling and the appearance of the first cells.  that leads to the speculation that life may have come here from elsewhere   panspermia.  if life did originate elsewhere,  dr. worden says,  one plausible source could bemars.  we know that large asteroid impacts can eject rocks from mars, some of which eventually land on earth.  however, since mars did not cool significantly earlier than earth, it s unlikely that life had a substantial head start there.  a more compelling possibility,  worden adds,  isinterstellar panspermia.  the solar system occasionally receives visitors from interstellar space   such as the object oumuamuadetected in 2017.  it s conceivable that microbial life could survive in shielded environments within such objects over long cosmic timescales.  if we accept this possibility, then life could have originated in environments much older than earth   potentially10 to 12 billion years ago, on planets orbiting stars long since extinguished.  one provocative analysis supporting this idea was published byalexei sharov and richard gordonin 2013: (sharov, a.a., & gordon, r. (2013).life before earth. arxiv:1304.3381).  their study proposed a method for estimating the age of life by extrapolating backward from currentgenetic complexity:  genetic complexity was measured as the number ofnon-redundant functional nucleotidesin genomes.  when plotted on alogarithmic scale versus time, the increase in complexity shows a linear trend.  extrapolating this trend back to an organism with justone base pairsuggests life originated~9.7 billion years ago.  since earth is only4.5 billion years old, this would imply life predated our planet.  while controversial,  dr. worden says,  this model offers a quantitative argument fora much older, possibly galactic origin of life.  an even more speculative   but technically feasible   idea isdirected panspermia, the deliberate seeding of life by an intelligent civilization.  in a recent paper, we explored how this could be achieved using technologies only slightly more advanced than ours: (mckay, c.p., davies, p.c.w., & worden, s.p.(2022).directed panspermia using interstellar comets.astrobiology, 22(12), 1443 1451. doi: 10.1089/ast.2021.0188) this directed panspermia concept was proposed byfrancis crick,co-discoverer of the dna double helix, andleslie orgel: (crick, f.h.c., & orgel, l.e. (1973).  directed panspermia .icarus, 19(3), 341 346. doi: 10.1016/0019-1035(73)90110-3)how to test these ideas the key to resolving whether life began on earth or elsewhere lies indiscovering life beyond earthand comparing itsgenetic and biochemical characteristicswith those of terrestrial life, especially luca.  for example,  worden adds: if we discover life onmars,europa, or even in theclouds of venus, and it shares the same ribosomal machinery or genetic code as earth life, this would strongly suggest acommon origin  possibly via interstellar panspermia.  if we instead findradically different biochemistry(e.g. non-water solvents like sulfuric acid or ammonia, or different nucleic acids), this would suggest thatlife arises independentlyin diverse environments   making the universe truly teeming with diverse life forms. editorial standardsreprints & permissions"

    "text": "jakarta (antara) - the ministry of primary and secondary education (kemendikdasmen) has begun preparing the concept for integrated excellent schools following president prabowo subianto s directive during a recent cabinet plenary session.although the ministry has not yet received direct instructions from the president, initial steps in drafting the concept have already started.minister of primary and secondary education abdul mu ti explained that during the cabinet session, president prabowo instructed kemendikdasmen to design a concept for non-boarding integrated excellent schools.he said that even though the program will not be implemented immediately, the ministry s team has started formulating its conceptual framework. we have not yet received direct instructions since the program will not start soon. however, we will continue developing the concept,  mu ti said during the kemendikdasmen one-year media briefing at plaza insan berprestasi, building a of the kemendikdasmen office, central jakarta, on wednesday evening.according to mu ti, the general direction of the school s development is already clear.the integrated excellent schools are expected to combine three education levels - elementary, junior high, and senior high - within a single educational area. the program will be implemented gradually, with a target of establishing at least one school in each sub-district.he added that while detailed technical discussions have not yet taken place, kemendikdasmen has started reviewing and comparing several existing school models that apply a similar approach.one such example is the integrated excellent school built by the samarinda city government, which uses the cambridge curriculum and is equipped with ideal educational facilities and infrastructure. at this stage, we have informally reviewed several existing models. for instance, last month i visited samarinda, east kalimantan, where the city government has already built an integrated excellent school,  mu ti said.regarding the possibility of utilizing schools with a small number of students as part of the integrated excellent school plan, mu ti stated that the matter is still under discussion.the same applies to the potential provision of land and infrastructure by local governments, which has not yet been discussed in detail. that issue has not been discussed yet. our current focus is on preparing the curriculum, teacher recruitment, and other academic aspects. technical matters such as land provision and facilities will likely be discussed at a later stage,  he added.earlier, on monday (october 20), president prabowo announced during the cabinet plenary session that around 7,000 integrated excellent schools would be built starting in 2026.the initiative aims to expand access to quality education and ensure equal learning opportunities across indonesia.the president also plans to form a special inter-ministerial task force to prepare the development of these schools in every sub-district. i have asked the ministry of higher education, research, and innovation, along with the ministry of primary and secondary education, and possibly other ministries, to establish a special task force to study the development of integrated schools in every sub-district,  president prabowo said.through this program, the government seeks to promote equitable access to quality and integrated education, establishing a strong foundation for enhancing indonesia s human resource development nationwide.related news:indonesia accelerates poverty cut with 500 new sekolah rakyat schoolsrelated news:indonesia distributes 288,000 panels to boost school digitalizationrelated news:indonesia targets nobel prize and top 100 global university rankingtranslator: hana dewi kinarina kaban, primayantieditor: m razi rahmancopyright   antara 2025"

    "text": "neutrino partnerships bridge pacific to probe cosmic mysteriesby whitney clavin for caltech newspasadena ca (spx) oct 23, 2025altech researchers co-lead new study refining what we know about the ghostly particlesvery early on in our universe, when it was a seething hot cauldron of energy, particles made of matter and antimatter bubbled into existence in equal proportions. for example, negatively charged electrons were created in the same numbers as their antimatter siblings, positively charged positrons. when the two particles combined, they canceled each other out.billions of years later, our world is dominated by matter. somehow matter \"won out\" over antimatter, but scientists still do not know how. now, two of the largest experiments attempting to find answers - projects that focus on subatomic particles called neutrinos - have joined forces.in a new nature study, an international collaboration representing the experiments - nova in the united states and t2k in japan - present some of the most precise neutrino measurements in the field. the two teams decided to combine their data to learn more than any one experiment alone could.\"by bringing these two efforts together, we can tease out new insights into how neutrinos work,\" says ryan patterson (bs '00), professor of physics at caltech, who co-led the nova side of the study.a goal of both projects is to determine whether regular neutrinos and antineutrinos (their antimatter counterparts) behave in ways that are asymmetrical relative to each other. this asymmetry could explain why matter was favored over antimatter in the early universe. the new results do not yet indicate whether this is the case, but the exquisite measurements bring scientists closer to understanding the mystery.\"neutrino physics is a strange field. it is very challenging to isolate effects,\" says kendall mahn, a professor at michigan state university and the co-spokesperson for t2k.both experiments are known as \"long baseline,\" which means they send neutrinos traveling through earth's crust for hundreds of kilometers. nova, the numi off-axis ?e appearance experiment, sends a beam of neutrinos 810 kilometers from its source at the u.s. department of energy's fermi national accelerator laboratory (fermilab) near chicago to a 14,000-ton neutrino detector in ash river, minnesota.the t2k experiment's neutrino beam travels 295 kilometers west from the city of tokai in central japan tokamioka - hence the name t2k. tokai is home to the japan proton accelerator research complex (j-parc) and kamioka hosts the super-kamiokande neutrino detector, an enormous tank of ultrapure water located a kilometer underground. in 1998, super-kamiokande discovered that neutrinos have mass, a landmark finding that later earned two of its discoverers the 2015 nobel prize in physics.but while neutrinos have mass, they are extremely lightweight and often referred to as ghostly for their ability to travel unhindered through substances like the ground beneath us. they come in three flavors: the electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino. as neutrinos travel through space or in the ground, they can switch flavors. if you think of the flavors as being like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla, this would be like finding your strawberry ice cream cone turned to chocolate on your way home.the phenomenon, called neutrino oscillation, has to do with the fact that each flavor is a quantum superposition of three different mass \"states,\" each with its own distinct mass. as the neutrinos travel, the relative proportions of each of those three mass states will shift, which changes their flavor. the big question for neutrino scientists is whether regular neutrinos and antineutrinos change flavors in different, asymmetric ways. if they do, this would help solve the missing antimatter problem.to study neutrino oscillation, the researchers produce neutrinos or antineutrinos of a specific flavor at the source of the experiments and then measure what flavors arrive at the detectors. in the case of nova, for example, this means sending the particles from fermilab to the detector in minnesota.\"as our neutrinos travel through earth's crust, they pick up another sort of asymmetry en route in addition to the possible intrinsic asymmetry in the particles themselves. it is this intrinsic asymmetry that may help explain the lack of antimatter in our universe,\" patterson says. \"both effects teach us new things about neutrinos but separating them is key.\"one tricky aspect of studying neutrino oscillation is that scientists do not know the actual masses of the three mass states making up each flavor of neutrino. it is like knowing strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream are made of three unique ingredients in different proportions but not knowing how heavy the ingredients are.scientists are actively trying to figure out the relative ordering of the three mass states. in the case of our three ice cream ingredients, this is like asking how their masses compare to each other. there are two possible ordering schemes. under so-called normal ordering, two of the mass states are relatively light and one is heavy, while an inverted ordering has two heavier mass states and one light.\"resolving the ordering question is another central goal in the field,\" patterson explains. \"it connects to a wide array of phenomena from the subatomic to the cosmological scale.\"the combined results of nova and t2k so far do not favor one mass ordering scenario over another. however, if future results show the neutrino mass ordering is inverted and not normal, nova's and t2k's results published this week provide evidence that neutrinos do exhibit the suspected asymmetry, potentially explaining why the universe is dominated by matter instead of antimatter.in the future, the scientists will analyze more data from nova and t2k, as well as data acquired by planned neutrino experiments that, when operational in the early 2030s, will provide even more precise measurements. caltech scientists, led by patterson, are helping to develop the fermilab-based deep underground neutrino experiment (dune) under construction in illinois and south dakota.with its longer baseline of 1,300 kilometers, dune will be more sensitive to the neutrino mass ordering than nova and t2k, and it could give physicists a conclusive answer shortly after it turns on. japan is also building a new neutrino experiment, hyper-kamiokande, a sequel to super-kamiokande, and china is building an experiment called the jiangmen underground neutrino observatory.research report:joint neutrino oscillation analysis from the t2k and nova experimentsrelated linksdeep underground neutrino experimentstellar chemistry, the universe and all within it"

    "text": "the following is a preview of daily signal politics editor bradley devlin s interview with state department deputy spokesman tommy pigott on  the signal sitdown.  the full interview premieres on the daily signal s youtube page at 6:30 a.m. eastern on oct. 23.while president donald trump did not receive the nobel peace prize this year, he could be the odds-on favorite to win the distinguished award in 2026 because of his work brokering peace deals or ceasefires in eight different conflicts this year.trump s deal-making diplomacy comes as left-wing critics thought this level of success impossible because of trump and secretary of state marco rubio s efforts to completely reform the state department. the critics were wrong. state department deputy spokesman tommy pigott joins the signal sitdown to provide an inside look at the department overhaul and how trump has managed to find pathways to peace all over the world.what trump, rubio, and the political appointees at the state department like pigott inherited from the biden administration, in terms of both the geopolitical conditions and the internal conditions at the agency, was nothing short of disastrous. from a geopolitical context, i mean, we saw what happened under the previous administration, actions that, as president trump has said, are some of the most embarrassing in our country s history. really terrible days from the afghanistan withdrawal to the wars that broke out,  pigotttold the daily signal.the biden administration  had not prioritized the right things,  pigott continued.  we ve seen conflicts breaking out all over the world. we see a united states that s no longer respected. that s what we inherited. the biden administration s poor prioritization of america and its interests was painfully on display inside the agency that trump and rubio inherited.before thereorganization, the state department was a bureaucratic nightmare, so much so that many careers who provided advice on the department s restructuring emphasized the need to streamline the department s processes.  the state department has so many different offices that one office could be doing something in a country that the embassy has no idea about,  pigott said.  and both of those entities could potentially be doing something that is contrary to the policy of the duly elected president of the united states.  for example, many of the aid programs that were in place could actually be doing things that are counter to the relationships we re trying to build in many of these countries,  pigott explained.  sometimes the ambassador didn t even know about the aid programs happening in the country where they were the ambassador. things were so bad at the state department, in fact, that trump s political appointees had a difficult time simply tracking down how many people actually worked there.meanwhile, policies that pigott described as  woke  and  dei  pervaded the work. between bureaucratic overhead and the woke policies,  in some of these programs, the previous administration was very happy to get this to 15 cents on the dollar in terms of reaching the end user,  pigott claimed.the goal for the state department reorganization was to end the bureaucratic grift and  empower people,  pigott told the daily signal. let s empower the embassies. let s actually make a structure that can implement the president s policies,  pigott said.  part of this reform was empowering the regional bureaus because the regional bureaus and the embassies were the experts in these regions.  of course we kept some of the functional bureaus that we needed,  pigott added.  but the idea was empowering the regional bureaus because the people that are part of those regional bureaus know the countries the best.  we shouldn t have functional activities that are counter to what the regional experts think we should be doing in each country,  pigott said.  that s oftentimes actually counterproductive. meanwhile, the administration has racked up several major diplomatic wins in the form of peace agreements and ceasefires.one of these successes was a ceasefire between india and pakistan in may, when the two countries were entering an escalatory spiral over the long-standing kashmir border dispute. you ve heard leaders from across the world talk about the stakes that were involved, especially when you re talking about two nuclear-armed powers and the danger for miscommunication,  pigott said about the india-pakistan ceasefire. we saw members of this administration from the vice president, the president, the secretary across this administration, reaching out, having conversations at all times of the day to make sure that we re communicating with the different countries here and really trying to find a way to keep this from escalating,  pigott said of the administration s efforts.the biggest deal the trump administration has managed to strike thus far is a 20-point peace plan in the war between israel and hamas. while the ceasefire continues to hold, challenges from both sides in the conflict make the path to lasting peace a long and narrow one a reality this administration knows full well. no one is denying how hard this is or how complex this is,  pigott said of implementing the peace deal.  as jared kushner said recently, [there are] 10 things we re trying to do simultaneously in terms of implementing this peace plan.  but there is a chance here for long-term peace and prosperity for the people of gaza, israel, the entire region, because the entire region, the entire world, is behind this peace plan,  pigott claimed. our focus now is making it livable, making gaza livable,  pigott said of the next steps for the peace agreement.  let s be practical. let s be realistic. let s focus on the progress we can make today on the ground. let s focus on that. while many challenges remain, pigott told the daily signal,  i think as americans, we can be proud that we have a president who is a peacemaker. related posts:trump responds to israel bombing in qatar4 key takeaways from trump s cabinet meetingtrump casts vision of prosperous, peaceful middle east

aghion, and peter howitt won the nobel prize in economics for explaining innovation-driven growth.mokyr s work highlights the importance of combining propositional and prescriptive knowledge for sustained economic growth.for new zealand, mokyr emphasises education, openness to global ideas, and minimal government intervention in innovation.this month s nobel prize in economics arrives at an opportune moment. the award to joel mokyr, philippe aghion and peter howitt for having explained innovation-driven economic growth provides a salutary reminder about what drives prosperity. and what does not.it is rare for an economic historian to winthe nobel prize. a professor at northwestern university, mokyr s booksthe lever of riches,the enlightened economyanda culture of growthexplain how the industrial revolution happened.he shares the prize with aghion andhowitt, whose theoretical work explores capitalism s  creative destruction.  the shared prize signals something important. the committee is directing our attention to the deep structures that underpin prosperity.advertisementadvertise with nzme.mokyr s contribution centres on a deceptively simple insight: sustained economic growth requires useful knowledge, and useful knowledge comes in two forms. the first is propositional knowledge   understanding why things work.the second is prescriptive knowledge   knowing how to make them work. think of propositional knowledge as the laws of thermodynamics; prescriptive knowledge as the technical manual for building a steam engine.for most of human history, these two types of knowledge developed separately. craftsmen knew recipes and techniques without understanding underlying principles. scholars developed theories with no thought to practical application.what changed? the industrial revolution happened when britain created institutions that brought these two kinds of knowledge together. scientific societies, journals, encyclopaedias and improved postal services created what mokyr calls  the republic of letters    a transnational community where knowledge flowed freely across borders and between practitioners.advertisementadvertise with nzme.crucially, this was not a government programme. the republic of letters was voluntary, decentralised and international. it emerged from a culture that valued curiosity, tolerated dissent and rewarded innovation. britain s open society meant people were free to experiment. its property rights and patent system meant they could profit from success.ming dynasty china, in mokyr s telling, shows the opposite path. china had led the world technologically for centuries. yet sustained growth never emerged. successive emperors halted geographical exploration in the 15th and 16th centuries, cutting their subjects off from the rest of the world.without openness to new ideas and foreign knowledge, innovation withered. centralised control, however well-intentioned, strangled the very dynamism it might have hoped to foster.for new zealand, mokyr s work offers vital lessons. not about what government should do, but about what conditions allow prosperity to emerge.first, education must transmit useful knowledge. both propositional and prescriptive knowledge matter. we need citizens who understand why things work   the scientific literacy to grasp thermodynamics, genetics, probability. we also need skilled tradespeople who know how to apply that knowledge   the engineers, technicians and craftsmen who turn theory into practice.new zealand s education system has drifted from this purpose. our curriculum emphasises competencies over content, process over knowledge. yet without a rich base of factual knowledge, critical thinking is impossible. you cannot solve problems in fields you know nothing about. fortunately, thecurrent minister of education is changing this.second, we must remain radically open. mokyr shows that britain succeeded partly because it drew on knowledge from across europe and beyond. the republic of letters was international by design. ideas and skilled people must flow freely.this has obvious implications for new zealand s restrictive foreign investment regime. like ireland, we should be treating foreign capital as a prize to be won, not a privilege to be rationed. but openness means more than investment. it means welcoming skilled migrants.advertisementadvertise with nzme.it means universities collaborating internationally. it means businesses and government adopting global best practice, not insisting on homegrown alternatives.third, the state must resist the temptation to direct innovation. this is perhaps mokyr s most pointed lesson. the industrial revolution succeeded because no one was in charge of it.knowledge emerged from competitive, voluntary exchange among thousands of participants. scientists, inventors and craftsmen collaborated because it served their interests, not because a ministry coordinated them.the modern temptation is to place government at the centre. create agencies to attract investment. reform research institutes to focus on commercialisation. pick winners. yet mokyr s work suggests this is precisely backwards.sustained growth comes from removing obstacles, not from state entrepreneurship. it comes from protecting property rights, enforcing contracts, maintaining competitive markets and ensuring the free flow of knowledge. it comes from a culture that celebrates innovation and tolerates the disruption it brings.the great risk is that governments, armed with confidence and public resources, imagine they can engineer prosperity. they cannot. at best, they can remove the barriers that prevent it from emerging. at worst, they smother it with direction and control.mokyr s nobel reminds us that prosperity is a discovery process, not a planning process. it emerges from freedom   the freedom to experiment, to fail, to learn and to try again.it requires institutions that allow knowledge to flow and reputations to be built on contribution rather than credential. it demands tolerance for the creative destruction that sees old products and companies displaced by better ones.new zealand s challenge is resisting the seductive belief that the right minister with the right agency can unlock growth. mokyr s work shows otherwise. the role of government is not to lead the orchestra but to ensure the concert hall has good acoustics, the doors are open to the audience, and the players are free to perform.catch up on the debates that dominated the week by signing up to ouropinion newsletter  a

figures in ai research: geoffrey hinton and yoshua bengio. the two computer scientists developed several of the technologies that underpin today s large language models.hinton, whowonhalf the 2024 nobel prize in physics for his contributions to ai research, invented the backpropagation algorithm that neural networks use to learn new skills. hinton earlier received the turing prize, the most prestigious award in computer science, together with two other researchers. one of those researchers was bengio, who led early work on embeddings and developed a predecessor to llms  attention mechanism.today s agi statement also drew the backing of numerous other prominent figures. the group includes four other nobel laureates besides hinton, dozens of professors and apple inc. co-founder steve wozniak. beyond the academic and technology ecosystems, the statement drew the backing of a half-dozen former members of congress, three members of the european parliament, prince harry, meghan markle, richard branson and others.notably, the statement was also signed by two current employees of openai and anthropic pbc. the two companies would likely be among the first affected by initiatives to regulate agi development.the release of the statement comes less a year and a half after the publication of ahigh-profile open letterfocused on the risks posed by ai. in the letter, a group of current and former openai, anthropic and google deepmind employees called on ai companies to address those risks more transparently. the document was endorsed by hinton and

(photo: toshifumi kitamura/afp via getty images)social issuesalthough takaichi has made history by becoming japan s first female prime minister, she is by no stretch of the imagination a feminist. she has long advocated for traditional gender roles and programs to help couples start families, and does not believe in same-sex marriage. she also reportedlydoes not believethat women should keep their maiden name after marrying.economictakaichi is not as fiscally conservative as her fellow party members and seems to support modern monetary theory, the theory that a government can simply print money as needed without being constrained by tax revenue or debt. she has called for much higher public spending in the defense sector, combined with tax cuts to stimulate growth. her proposed economic policies are similar tothose of the late abe, who attempted to transform japan s stalling economy with more stimulus money and negative short-term interest rates that made it easier for consumers and companies to spend and borrow money.liberal democratic party (ldp) president sanae takaichi stands up and bows to acknowledge the applause after she was selected as japan s new prime minister during an extraordinary session of the lower house of parliament in tokyo on october 21, 2025. (photo by philip fong/afp via getty images)(photo by philip fong/afp via getty images)chinatakaichi is considered a china hawk. as part of her agenda, she will likely attempt to achieve a longtime policy goal of staunch japanese conservatives: ananti-espionage lawthat would presumably target chinese communist party (ccp) spies working within the country. she has alsoadvocatedfor more defense spending and re-militarization, revising japan s pacifist, post-wwii constitution, and has expressed support for a security partnership with taiwan   what amounts to a slap in the face to the  one china  policy of the ccp. her visits to the yasukuni shrine, which honors the spirits of japan s dead soldiers, have sparked diplomatic protests in china and south korea.(related ascent of japan s  iron lady  could be the wake-up call countries in china s shadow need)us president donald trump and japan s prime minister shinzo abe take part in a working lunch at trump s mar-a-lago estate in palm beach, florida on april 18, 2018.

    "text": "synopsismichel h devoret, awarded the nobel prize in physics, demonstrated in the 1980s that quantum mechanics  unusual properties could appear in visible electrical circuits, enabling superconducting qubits. his work underpins quantum computing, now advancing rapidly at google, promising breakthroughs in drug discovery, materials science, and problems unsolvable by classical computers.michel h devoretwas one of three physicists who won this year'snobel prize in physicsfor a series of experiments they conducted more than four decades ago.as a postdoctoral researcher at theuniversity of california,berkeley, in the mid-1980s, devoret helped show that the strange and powerful properties of quantum mechanics -- the physics of the subatomic realm -- could also be observed in electrical circuits large enough to be seen with the naked eye.that discovery, which paved the way for cellphones and fiber-optic cables, may have greater implications in the coming years as researchers build quantum computers that could be vastly more powerful than today's computing systems. that could lead to the discovery of new medicines and vaccines as well as cracking the encryption techniques that guard the world's secrets.on wednesday, devoret and his colleagues at agooglelab near santa barbara, california, said their quantum computer had successfully run a new algorithm capable of accelerating advances in drug discovery, the design of new building materials and other fields.leveraging the counterintuitive powers of quantum mechanics, google's machine ran this algorithm 13,000 times as fast as a top supercomputer executing similar code in the realm of classical physics, according to a paper written by the google researchers in the scientific journal nature.\"in the future when we have bigger quantum computers, we will be able to run calculations that would be impossible with classical algorithms,\" said devoret, who joined google in 2023.quantum computingis still an experimental technology. but google's new algorithm, quantum echoes, shows that scientists are rapidly improving techniques that could allow quantum computers to crack scientific problems no traditional computing device ever could.\"it's a meaningful technological advance,\" said prineha narang, a professor of physical sciences and electrical and computer engineering at ucla. \"we have heard a lot about hardware advances in the field, and for a while, i worried that the algorithms would not keep up. but they have shown that this is not the case.\"google's quantum research is competing with other tech giants likemicrosoftandibm, myriad startups, universities and rapidly advancing efforts in china. the chinese government has committed more than $15.2 billion to quantum research.inside a classical computer like a laptop or a smartphone, silicon chips store numbers as \"bits\" of information. each bit holds either a 1 or a 0. the chips then perform calculations by manipulating these bits -- adding them, multiplying them and so on.a quantum computer, by contrast, performs calculations in ways that defy common sense.according to the laws of quantum mechanics -- the physics of very small things -- a single object can behave like two separate objects at the same time. by exploiting this strange phenomenon, scientists can build quantum bits, or \"qubits,\" that hold a combination of 1 and 0 at the same time.this means that as the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.with two other researchers at berkeley in the mid-1980s, john m. martinis and john clarke, devoret showed that the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics were not limited to subatomic particles. they also appeared in electrical circuits that could be used to build computer chips.\"we showed for the first time that you could build atoms out of electrical circuits,\" devoret said.the discovery laid the foundation for the \"superconducting qubits\" that google, ibm and many other companies use to power their quantum computers. this involves cooling certain metals to extremely low temperatures so they exhibit the same strange behavior as subatomic particles.today's quantum computers still make too many mistakes. but thanks to recent advances in error correction -- a way of reducing mistakes -- many scientists now believe the technology can live up to its promise by around the end of the decade.google announced last year that it had built a quantum computer that needed less than five minutes to perform a particularly complex mathematical calculation in a test designed to gauge the progress of the technology. one of the world's most powerful nonquantum supercomputers would not have been able to complete it in 10 septillion years, a length of time that exceeds the age of the known universe by billions of trillions of years.this moment of \"quantum supremacy\" showed that the technology was beginning to push beyond the powers of classical computers. but the calculation performed by google's machine, based on a chip called willow, had no practical use.google and its many rivals are still working toward the moment when a quantum computer can surpass what is possible with a classical computer as it performs important tasks in fields like chemistry and artificial intelligence.\"for the promise of quantum computers to be unlocked, we need to produce a new drug that we only know about because of quantum computers,\" narang said. \"then you can say that all the investment was worthwhile.\"google's new algorithm is a step in that direction. in another paper published wednesday on the research site arxiv, the company showed that its algorithm could help improve what is called nuclear magnetic resonance, or nmr, which is a technique used to understand the structure of tiny molecules and how they interact with one another.nmr is a vital part of effort to develop new medicines for fighting disease and new materials for building everything from cars to buildings. it can help understand alzheimer's disease or drive the creation of entirely new metals, said ashok ajoy, an assistant professor of chemistry at berkeley who specializes in nmr and worked with google's researchers on the new paper.\"this illustrates the power of a quantum computer,\" he said. \"it

(one angstrom is one-tenth of a nanometer, which is less than half the width of a single atom). the technique enables optical microscopes to localize atomic-scale features in any material that has a known atomic pattern, such as crystalline materials or certain proteins with repeating molecular chains.the team says the method could help guide the design of quantum devices, which often require placing individual atoms precisely within a crystal. beyond quantum technologies, digit can also provide new insights into how defects and impurities shape the behavior of advanced materials   from semiconductors to superconductors.duan s co-authors at mit are qiushi gu, hanfeng wang, yong hu, kevin chen, matthew trusheim, and eecs professor dirk englund.grid supportscientists can image features smaller than a nanometer, and sometimes as small as a single atom, but not with optical microscopes. in these cases, they use transmission or scanning electron microscopes, which send high-energy beams of electrons into a sample to generate an image based on the pattern in which the electrons scatter. these electron-based methods produce highly detailed, near-atomic-scale images, but they require imaging in a vacuum and at high energies, and only work in ultrathin, synthetic, or solid-state materials. electron-based imaging methods are too harsh for more delicate living specimens.in contrast, optical microscopes work at lower energies, in ambient conditions, and are safe to apply to biological samples. but they cannot discern features past the diffraction limit. essentially, a microscope is unable to see features that are smaller than half the wavelength of visible light (about 200 to 300 nanometers) that a microscope sends in to probe a sample. atoms, then, have long eluded optical microscopes.in 2014, however, the nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to developers of a technique to overcome the diffraction limit. super-resolution microscopy works by shining laser light on a sample at a specific frequency that is known to resonate with a feature of interest, such as a certain molecule. when that molecule resonates, it effectively announces its presence in the material. with this optical manipulation, scientists can visualize features as small as 10 nanometers, on the scale of a single molecule.duan and englund looked to resolve even smaller features by combining super-resolution techniques with statistical analysis and knowledge of materials that has often been overlooked. one thing that gets ignored in imaging optical systems is the physical configuration of your system,  duan says.  for example, if you want to visualize defects in a diamond system, these defects can only be at certain positions, since they have to follow the grid of the atomic diamond structure. in proteins, there are some structures that grow in an organized grid, and their location must be somewhere along that physical grid. the researchers suspected that if they had a reasonably accurate map of a material s atomic structure (imagine the ball-and-stick models of molecules in a chemistry classroom), they might use such maps as a template and try out many different orientations and rotation angles to find the closest match to whatever features are initially visualized using super-resolution microscopy. no one has ever done this before, to include the physical constraints or system information into the resolution technique,  duan says.blurriness, collapsedto test their idea, the researchers worked with a sample of diamond   a crystal whose microstructure is well-understood and resembles an organized grid, or lattice, of repeating carbon atoms. the researchers blindly knocked out some carbon atoms in the lattice and replaced them with silicon atoms using facilities at mit.nano. their goal was to identify and determine the precise locations of the errant silicon atoms.to do so, they first used established techniques of super-resolution microscopy to probe the diamond sample, using lasers set to specific wavelengths at frequencies known to resonate with the silicon atoms but not the carbon atoms. with this technique, researchers produced images that depicted the silicon atoms, but only as a uniform blur.the team then applied digit to further resolve the picture. knowing that diamond in general has a grid-like configuration of carbon atoms, the researchers took this configuration as a map, or seating chart of sorts, and assumed that any silicon atoms that took the place of a carbon atom must sit within the grid, which has a known spacing between atoms. because the silicon atoms are substituting carbon atoms in the lattice, that means they must obey some integer multiple of the atomic spacing of the crystal lattice, separating any two silicon atoms,  englund says.  that prior knowledge makes the localization different than if you add a purely amorphous material. the researchers essentially simulated many possibilities of orientations and rotation angles of the diamond lattice, superimposed on the blurry image of atoms that the super-resolution microscopy technique produced. the trick is that, in certain materials, atoms aren t spread out randomly   they sit on a grid inside a crystal,  duan explains.  we used that prior knowledge to sharpen the microscope s picture. once we factored in that  atomic grid,  the blurriness collapsed, and we could pinpoint exact positions. in the end, they found the technique could pinpoint the location of individual silicon atoms within the diamond lattice, with a precision of 0.178 angstroms   the sharpest resolution of any optical-based imaging technique. the team has made the digit code available on github for anyone to apply to their optical measurements, provided their sample of interest has a well-understood atomic structure. then, they hope that scientists will start to see much finer and detailed features and processes using light. it s a big step   it takes optical microscopes into the realm of atomic scale, something people thought only electron microscopes or x-rays could do,  duan says.  that opens up a whole new way of studying materials and biology. sharethis news article on:xfacebooklinkedinredditprintpaper:  a bayesian approach towards atomically-precise localization in fluorescence microscopy related linksyuqin

    "text": "new york timesthe world will look to seoul next week as leaders gather for a major economic summit and presidenttrumpand presidentxi jinpingof china are expected to meet for the first time since 2019. both leaders hope the meeting will stabilize the superpowers' rocky relations. but even a d tente in the u.s.-china trade war will not restore faith in america's economic leadership. by continuing to wield sky-high tariffs punitively, unilaterally and unpredictably, mr. trump has upended the rules-based international economic order that america led for 80 years.the tariff campaign is but one prong of mr. trump's assault on the laws and institutions washington designed to advance its own power and privilege after world war ii. the world is now grappling with what it means for the reigning global leader to renounce the very system designed to sustain its rule. without a plan for what comes next and no natural successor, the united states is not only hastening its own decline but also forcing the world into a new era of disorder.throughout modern history, wars have wrecked global systems, with new structures emerging afterward. following world war ii, america and its allies designed an approach to govern the relations among nations in hopes of restoring prosperity to a devastated globe and preventing future conflict. theunited nationsstood as the primary governing body, while other rules and institutions, such as theworld trade organization, were built alongside it over time. at the apex of its power and the only allied country to have avoided the destruction of total war, the united states became the leader and operator of this new world order.the post-world war ii system was successful precisely because it delivered for america's partners, too. political, economic and security cooperation created stability, predictability and political and economic gains for many nations. washington accepted restraints on its power because it recognized that securing other countries' buy-in was a more effective strategy for advancing its global aims than coercion. while this global order was undoubtedly imperfect and in many ways outmoded, it still gave washington the advantage when mr. trump took office for a second term in january.now the trump administration is on a campaign of systemic incineration. \"the postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us,\"marco rubiosaid during his january secretary of state confirmation hearing. rather than free and open trade, the administration has enacted crippling tariffs, punishing not just violators of trade rules like china but also american allies and american consumers with the higher prices that come from tariffs.live eventsrather than upholding sovereignty and the principle of nonaggression, mr. trump is threatening military action against venezuela, yet took no concrete action when russia violated nato airspace. mr. trump has courted autocratic leaders likevladimir putinof russia, mr. xi andkim jong unof north korea while suggesting washington might not defend its democratic allies.it is a stunning act of superpower suicide: never before has the world's reigning superpower intentionally dismantled a system designed to sustain its own leadership, particularly while those trappings were returning enormous benefits.this era will not end in one convulsion -- the kind of big bang event that has historically birthed new world orders. instead, the next several years will almost certainly be a chaotic interregnum whose contours are coming into focus. the united states will remain immensely powerful, even if capricious and performative. the old institutions will no doubt endure: the u.n. will still convene and judges will review cases at the world trade organization, but with diminished capacity to overcome member nations' natural tendency toward competition and conflict. shared challenges, from pandemics to climate change to artificial intelligence, may go largely unaddressed.a more disorderly world will almost certainly be a more violent one. this has already been a bloody year, including armed conflicts in south and southeast asia and israeli strikes in qatar, syria, lebanon, yemen and iran, as well as wars in sudan, ukraine and gaza. the trump administration joined israel in its war on iran, and led its own strikes against the houthis and in the caribbean. mr. trump professes to want peace, but, apart from the recent gaza cease-fire, appears more focused on lobbying for the nobel peace prize than for the sustained execution that makes peace deals stick.these clashes may extend to the economic sphere. nationalism and mercantilism are supplanting the prevailing premium on free and open trade, with america leading the charge with the highest tariffs in a century. economic disintegration will not only slow global growth, it will also pit countries against one another in a race to acquire resources, from critical minerals to advanced semiconductors.the world will need a new ordering force. there are no signs that one will be forthcoming. as china gains ground, it is unequipped to take up the american mantle. beijing seeks a world that is safe for autocracy, allowing it to entrench party control at home and spread its influence abroad without interference. but it does not have viable plans for how to reduce conflict, create financial stability or manage transnational threats like nuclear proliferation.america's democratic allies in asia and europe may yet pull together to preserve what they can of the liberal international order. taken together, they match america's weight in g.d.p. terms. but domestic resistance at home to growing defense budgets in an increasingly tough economic landscape may stymie their ambitions.years from now, an american president may have the opportunity to work alongside other global leaders to build a new international order and blunt china's gains. they will face the closest thing to a geopolitical clean slate that we have seen since 1945. a new vision could turn disorder into an opportunity for reinvention: by deepening technological, economic and security cooperation with select american allies; seeding innovative approaches to economic development; or building institutions to include leading companies alongside countries. political aspirants preparing for that moment today must begin by recognizing there is no going back to the way things were.addas a reliable and trusted news sourceadd now!(you can now subscribe to oureconomic times whatsapp channel)read more news ontrumpworld trade organizationunited nationsxi jinpingvladimir putinkim jong unmarco rubio(catch all thebusiness news,breaking newsandlatest newsupdates onthe economic times.)subscribe tothe economic times primeand read theet epaperonline....moreless(you can now subscribe to oureconomic times whatsapp channel)read more news ontrumpworld trade organizationunited nationsxi jinpingvladimir putinkim jong unmarco rubio(catch all thebusiness news,breaking newsandlatest newsupdates onthe economic times.)subscribe tothe economic times primeand read theet epaperonline....morelessexplore more storiesfoo fighters set to rock detroit with monumental ford field concert in august 2026benjamin netanyahu would be arrested if he enters canada, affirms canadian prime minister mark carney to enforce icc arrest warranttony wakeham causes major upset in newfoundland and labrador;

it realizes a computation that would take much longer than with classical hardware.\"the quantum echoes algorithm works in several stages, amounting to a highly advanced echo in which a signal is sent into the quantum system and then reversed to listen for the \"echo\" that comes back, all amplified by constructive interference (a phenomenon in which quantum waves compound to become stronger).first, scientists ran a series of operations, or quantum gates, on an entangled 105-qubit array on the willow qpu. next, one qubit was perturbed, or deviated, before they ran the same exact operations in reverse. the result was a curious \"butterfly effect\" that could be used to reveal information about the quantum system. the scientists then used this algorithm to measure distances between atoms in the two molecules.to confirm the performance of the algorithm on willow versus on classical supercomputers, the scientists conducted rigorous \"red-teaming\" tests, borrowing from cybersecurity methods to verify the robustness of the results. these tests ran for the equivalent of 10 years.\"certainly, it throws down the gauntlet for any skeptics to try to reproduce their results classically,\"scott aaronson, chair of computer science at the university of texas at austin told live science. \"compared to previous quantum supremacy demonstrations, the big advantage here is that the output is a single number rather than a sample from a distribution, and therefore is in principle, efficiently verifiable   if not using a classical computer, then at least using a second quantum computer.\"related stories quantum record smashed as scientists build mammoth 6,000-qubit system   and it works at room temperature quantum computing 'lie detector' finally proves these machines tap into einstein's spooky action at a distance rather than just faking it 'this moves the timeline forward significantly': quantum computing breakthrough could slash pesky errors by up to 100 timesaaronson added that verifiablequantum supremacyis one of the biggest challenges in the field. he noted that google's goal across both new studies was not to solve a commercially useful problem but to get a clear advantage over a classical computer and enable another quantum computer to verify the answer independently.google launched thewillow quantum computing chipin december last year. the new processor demonstrated that as the number of qubits are scaled up, the errors that occur reduce exponentially, marking a key milestone in quantum computing research. but hardware improvements are not enough on their own   even if the machines could be scaled the millions of qubits required to beat classical computing. that's because the software and hardware components need to work together to find the most efficient route to solving a problem, as mi noted.google scientists claim that we will begin to see practical applications that are only possible with quantum computers in as little as five years. however, we would still need to scale up the hardware so that machines can operate with millions of qubits   something which is difficult to imagine today because the most powerful quantum computers only have 100s or 1,000s of qubits.keumars afifi-sabetchannel editor, technologykeumars is the technology editor at live science. he has written for a variety of publications including itpro, the week digital, computeractive, the independent, the observer, metro and techradar pro. he has worked as a technology journalist for more than five years, having previously held the role of features editor with itpro. he is an nctj-qualified journalist and has a degree in biomedical sciences from queen mary, university of london. he's also registered as a foundational chartered manager with the chartered management institute (cmi), having qualified as a level 3 team leader with distinction in 2023.you must confirm your public display name before commentingplease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.logoutlatest articles1you don't need to be very happy to avoid an early death from chronic disease, study finds2diagnostic dilemma: a toddler accidently ate gonorrhea bacteria from a lab dish3plants self-organize in a 'hidden order,' echoing pattern found across nature4james webb telescope finds that galaxies in the early universe were much more chaotic than we thought5new eye implants combined with augmented-reality glasses help blind people read again in small trial"

    "text": "ai + ml8dropping nvidia for amazon's custom chips helped gene therapy startup metagenomi cut ai bill 56%8it's not the size of your accelerator, it's how you use ittobias mannwed 22 oct 2025//14:43 utcgene editing startup metagenomi has tapped aws's inferentia 2 accelerators to speed the discovery of potentially life-saving therapies, and said its efforts cost 56 percent less than it would have incurred using nvidia gpus.founded in 2018, metagenomi is using a nobel prize-winning approach developed by jennifer doudna and emmanuelle charpentier calledcrispr, which allows for the targeted editing of gene sequences.\"gene editing is a new therapeutic modality aimed at treating disease by addressing the cause of disease at the genetic level. so rather than treating the symptoms, actually going after a cure,\" chris brown, vp of discovery at metagenomi, toldel reg.these therapies rely on identifying enzymes   essentially biological catalysts that facilitate chemical reactions   that can bind to the rna sequences that guide them to their destination, cut the target dna in the right spot, and   critically   fit in the delivery mechanism of choice.to find these enzymes, the startup is using a class of generative ai known as protein language models (plms), like progen2, to rapidly generate millions of potential candidates.\"it's about finding that one thing in a million. so if you've got access to twice as many, you're doubling your chances of potentially getting a product at the end,\" brown said.developed by researchers at salesforce, johns hopkins, and columbia universities in 2022,progen2is an auto-regressive transformer model not unlike gpt-2. but rather than spitting out strings of text, it synthesizes novel protein sequences.weighing in at about 800 million parameters for the base model, progen2 is tiny compared to modern large language models like gpt-4 or deepseek r1, which means running it doesn't require massive quantities of high-bandwidth memory. for the trial, metagenomi compared aws's inferentia 2 accelerator with nvidia's l40s, which the biotech startup had previously been using to run progen2.launched in 2023,inferentia 2is (as its name suggests) an inference-optimized accelerator, with 32gb of hbm, 820 gb/s of memory bandwidth, and 190 teraflops of 16-bit performance.by comparison, the l40s, based on nvidia's previous-gen ada lovelace gpu architecture, features 48gb of gddr6 good for 864 gb/s of memory bandwidth and 362 teraflops at 16-bit precision.but while the l40s outperforms inferentia 2 on paper, amazon claims its chip can do the job cheaper by taking advantage of its batch processing pipeline, aws batch, and spot instances.\"spot instances are generally 70-ish percent lower cost than on demand. because the workflows that they were optimizing for could be scheduled around spot instances utilizing aws batch, it really simplified these deployments ... and allowed them to schedule different types of experimentation to run around the clock,\" kamran khan, head of business development for the machine learning wing of aws's annapurna labs team, toldthe register.metagenomi and aws found that a combination of spot instances, clever batching, and cheap chips could cut metagenomi's operating costs by up to 56 percenta chunk of the savings from using inferentia came from greater availability. the cloud giant says the interruption rate for its homegrown chip is roughly five percent compared to 20 percent for nvidia's l40s-based spot instances. in theory, this means that only one in 20 of metagenomi's protein generation batches should be interrupted, versus one in five for nvidia's accelerator.amazon brain drain finally sent aws down the spouttrust the ai, says new coding manifesto by kim and yeggeamazon spills plan to nuke washington...with x-energy mini-reactorswe're all going to be paying ai's godzilla-sized power billsfor brown, inferentia's lower operating cost translates directly into more science, increasing the likelihood of discovering enzymes capable of targeting different ailments.\"we took a problem where it would have been one project for the year, and instead we turned it into something that my team can do multiple times a day or a week,\" brown said.the collab also highlights that for ai workloads that aren't interactive, faster hardware isn't always better   older, heavily discounted accelerators may offer better value.  get ourtech resourcessharemore aboutaiawsbiotechmore like these more aboutaiawsbiotechgpunarrower topicsaiopsamazon

most people don t want that. are worries about ai superintelligence also feeding ai hype?the letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the ai research community about the likelihood of superhuman ai, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be. in the past, it s mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,  said max tegmark, president of the future of life institute and a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology.  i feel what we re really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream. complicating the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or agi, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an ai bubble. openai was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and ai scientists when its researcher claimed chatgpt had figured out unsolved math problems   when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online. there s a ton of stuff that s overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn t change the fact that   zooming out   ai has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,  tegmark said.tegmark s group was also behind a march 2023 letter   still in the dawn of a commercial ai boom   that called on tech giants to pause the development of more powerful ai models temporarily. none of the major ai companies heeded that call. and the 2023 letter s most prominent signatory, elon musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own ai startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.asked if he reached out to musk again this time, tegmark said he wrote to the ceos of all major ai developers in the u.s. but didn t expect them to sign. i really empathize for them, frankly, because they re so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,  tegmark said.  i think that s why it s so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the u.s. government just steps in."

callahan familybut by thanksgiving weekend, the fund that had won awards was in big trouble. callahan had loaded up oncannabis stocks, betting that the drug s federal classification in the united states would change to effectively decriminalize it, triggering a bull run on associated stocks and a bonanza of mergers. but nothing changed and the bottom dropped out of the cannabis market as september turned into october.there were other issues, too. some investors had been threatening to pull out of the fund as the earlier robust returns began to dry up. his parents could see he was stressed. his father, a confidant and someone he spoke with almost daily at market close, suggested they have a heart-to-heart at the cottage, but his son didn t want to.article content chris had closed off at that point,  he said.callahan headed back to the city early on the holiday monday to beat the traffic and work was beckoning. but no matter what was troubling him, he managed a smile in parting and told his mom not to worry. a little more than two weeks later, he killed himself, leaving behind a heartbroken family, a bankrupt hedge fund and hundreds of investors left wondering where and how things could possibly go so wrong. people relied on chris; people thought,  oh, chris knows how to do that,  or  chris can figure that out,   his mom said.  but he was in a situation where he couldn t figure it out. he was the one who needed help, and that was something he couldn t deal with because if he needed help, people would think he was not perfect. callahan s lawyer informed theontario securities commission (osc)of his death on oct. 28, and the osc on oct. 30 ordered that traynor ridge capital inc. cease all trading activity. four days later, the ontario superior court of justice appointed ernst & young inc. as the fund s receiver, tasked with managing its wind-down and determining what, if any, money was left.the risk is always there with hedge funds, but the returns are notjames darroch, professor emeritus of strategic management at york university s schulich school of businessthe implosion of traynor ridge was chalked up as just another hedge fund trader who got burned for making some bad market bets. but callahan s life and the circumstances surrounding his death show the potential downside of ambition and, ultimately, isolation in a high-stakes poker game where a player s sense of self-worth can be reduced to their ability to generate monthly returns, and failure is perceived not as a part of life, but as a reason to end it.article contenta complete list of traynor ridge s portfolio holdings has not been made public, but according to the receiver, a  substantial portion  of the fund, which had assets valued at more than $94 million as of sept. 29, 2023, was invested in several cannabis companies, whose share prices precipitously tumbled in the weeks before callahan s death.callahan initiated a series of trades between oct. 11 and 20, according to an ontario superior court of justice claim filed by virtu canada corp., an investment dealer that had executed transactions on his instruction since traynor ridge s inception.funds had two days to settle up with the dealer following a trade, but traynor ridge did not settle its trades. what ensued was a rolling cascade of failed trades that, according to the virtu claim, allegedly led to more than $5 million in losses after the dealer took steps to liquidate the securities traynor ridge had instructed it to buy.some of callahan s trading activity toward the end may have involved  trading without any change in beneficial or economic ownership,  according to an osc document. a trader simultaneously buying and selling the same security, known as wash trading, boosts trading volumes, suggesting to the wider market that the security in question could be of interest.article contentit s a form of market manipulation, and a trader found guilty of it faces a range of penalties from a simple reprimand to fines of up to $5 million. no formal allegations have been made against traynor ridge to date, and a source, who is not authorized to speak on the matter, indicated the alleged trading activity did not reflect a wider pattern of behaviour and was instead perhaps among the final acts of a desperate young man.making a precarious situation worse was that traynor ridge was highly leveraged and buying securities on brokerage credit by borrowing at multiples against the underlying value of the portfolio s holdings, according to a source. should such a bet pay off, a fund reaps the returns and all is well, but if it doesn t, the losses are multiplied and a fund can find itself in jeopardy.with traynor ridge, the fall came swiftly. callahan was pulling the trigger on leveraged trades the fund did not have the money to cover, in addition to being saddled with illiquid holdings he could not get rid of.he had made the wrong bets. one general rule of hedge funds is that they are a riskier area for investors to play in and the higher the risk, the higher the expected return,  james darroch, professor emeritus of strategic management at york university s schulich school of business in toronto, said.  the risk is always there with hedge funds, but the returns are not. article contentthe beginning of the endjulie callahan starts each day with a list of 10 things she plans to accomplish and an understanding that the world is full of broken-hearted parents, so there s no point in sitting around  since there is always somebody else who is going through something worse, and there is always something nice to think about, but you have to find it. stephen callahan keeps busy in his own way. a bad back prevents him from being as active as he once was, so he reads all the newspapers he can get his hands on and thinks about chris.article contentjulie callahan holds a photo of her son christopher callahan at her toronto home.photo by peter j. thompson/national postjeff callahan, chris s younger brother, is quiet by nature, and the pain is etched upon his face when he speaks of his sibling s absence. we did everything together,  he said.the brothers were opposites. jeff could fix a boat s motor and pretty much anything else; chris could size up a complex financial spreadsheet and make sense of the numbers, talk politics and win debates, and he loved an audience, uncorking stories that made everybody laugh.he could also make a mean martini and pan-sear a prime steak   with butter, salt and pepper, garlic and rosemary   to perfection and he always, somehow, found time for family, friends and his partner, who shared in the knowledge that the best solution when one had a problem was to  go ask chris. article contenteven from a young age, callahan seemed to have all the answers. his mom is not the only one in the family who abides by the 10-things-a-day rule. her sons were expected to get up and get at it, and both were expected to have part-time jobs by the age of 16, a deadline callahan handily beat when a manager at the golf store he and his mom happened to be shopping at offered the 15-year-old a job on the spot after he gave an encyclopedic account of the club he was looking at as well as its selling points.that job led to another job at a big-box sporting goods store and a request from management to overhaul the store s computer system. outside work, callahan was his high school class president, a downhill skier, a backcountry canoeist and someone who was fascinated with business and armed with wisdom beyond his years, his dad said.an entrepreneurial thread runs through the family. callahan s dad is an architect who became a developer and his grandfather started his own accounting firm. other family members started businesses, and his younger brother would eventually start one, too. i can remember chris writing a business plan for a sailboat he had sketched out as a teenager,  his dad said.article contenta photo of christopher callahan reading the economist as a teenager while on holiday with his family. even at a young age, he was fascinated with business.photo by the callahan familydespite having parents with good connections, rather than enlist them to make a few calls on his behalf, callahan hustled to land an internship at what became echelon wealth partners inc. while studying applied economics at queen s university in kingston, ont. rob furse was the company s co-founder and president; callahan was the intern who won the office over.article content chris had a great combination of analytical hard skills, and they are a bit commodified, but what really set him apart was his people skills,  he said.  he was just a very personable, very energetic guy, and it may sound simple, but it is harder than you might think to find someone who can combine the smarts with the personable. it did not take long for the internship to blossom into a full-time opportunity on echelon s sales desk, a role that put callahan in contact with a number of hedge funds, including hgc investment management inc., which recognized what furse already knew   the guy had talent   and recruited the 23-year-old as an analyst. there were no hard feelings; we were happy for chris,  furse said.  it was definitely the next logical career step for him. the analyst eventually moved into an associate portfolio manager s position at hgc, but he resolved in 2019 to take a leap of faith in himself by starting his own hedge fund.hedging your betsthe canadian hedge fund industry consists of 246 funds with 130 managers and $200 billion in assets under management, according to a bank of montreal primer. that may sound like a lot of money, but it s pocket change compared to the canadian fund industry as a whole, which has more than $4 trillion under management and close to 7,000 funds.article contenthedge funds have different investment strategies, but the secret sauce is often a portfolio manager s ability to sniff out opportunities, do the research, analyze the numbers, attract high-net-worth individuals as well as corporate and institutional investors, and make the correct bets.bill ackman, the silver-haired founder of pershing square capital management lp, has billions of dollars at his disposal and has made several headline-grabbing forays into canada.but the industry is also home to much smaller fish, such as traynor ridge. big or small, merger arbitrage   taking a position on whether a merger deal between two companies will close   is a common hedge fund strategy and one callahan excelled at.a march 2023 traynor ridge fund overview broke down some of callahan s successes on this front, including a home run he hit involving the 2021 merger between supreme cannabis co. andcanopy growth corp., as well as another one that involved a competing bidder scenario for an australian energy company.callahan often zeroed in on securities that were trading for less than 50 cents, which was fundamental to traynor ridge s strategy of focusing on small-to-mid-cap companies in areas of the markets that the ackmans of the world are generally not interested in, but that can produce investment opportunities with  outsized risk/reward characteristics,  according to the fund s march 2023 overview.article contenttraynor ridge was named after a ski run in aspen, colo., that callahan and his brother barrelled down years before. on that trip, he met some folks who worked in finance, seeding the idea that someday he would do the same.article contentchristopher callahan, right, and his brother jeff on the ski hills. callahan s hedge fund, traynor ridge, was named after a ski run in aspen, colo., that he and his brother skied in the past.photo by the callahan familycallahan met furse for lunch before launching his fund in february 2020, laying out his vision and asking whether he would be willing to invest. it was a soft sales pitch, but furse did not need to be sold since he felt the technical knowledge and investment strategies callahan had gained while at hgc would allow the fund to scale well. i cut him a small cheque because i believed in chris,  he said.he was not the only one. at the time of callahan s death, traynor ridge had 310 investors, including some friends and family members, but the bulk of the money came from established bay street players, such as westcourt capital corp., a toronto-based investment advisory firm with a well-heeled clientele. westcourt declined an interview request, as did callahan s former colleagues at traynor ridge, one of whom previously worked at westcourt.traynor ridge started as a one-man show. in registering the fund with the osc, callahan structured it in such a way that he was its founder, chief compliance officer, investment officer, sole director, shareholder and ultimate designated person. in other words, even though he later wound up with two employees, the buck   the fund s investment decisions, strategy, trades, regulatory compliance, risk management and ultimate success or failure   stopped at him.article contentthere wasn t a board of governors, strategic advisers or wise industry sages on hand to offer advice, nor was there anything in the mountain of osc paperwork requiring that to be in place.what seems a possible red flag in hindsight did not handicap the fund as it got off the ground. investors piled aboard, buoyed by the promise of high returns. one investor recalls buying in based on the recommendation of their financial adviser.he said they were not aware that callahan had so many overlapping roles with traynor ridge and that due diligence on the fund had been left to a trusted adviser with a track record for delivering results. i was shocked to learn that you can set up a hedge fund and not have more oversight from regulators,  the investor, who requested anonymity, said.he never met callahan in person, but received monthly updates on the fund s performance from their adviser. prior to october 2023, it was  business as usual,  they said. two years later, he has still not received any correspondence from the receiver or the osc and he has no expectations that he will ever see a nickel from what was a substantial investment. what happened should not have happened,  he said.another investor similarly laid the blame squarely at the feet of the osc for allowing hedge fund founders/principals to also be the chief compliance officer. it s a structure, he said, that lends itself to  risky  trades.article content while such a structure might make sense for the early stages of a startup, it surely doesn t when the amount of managed assets reaches $50-plus million,  he said.callahan, however, was not operating in a complete vacuum. he did speak with his dad, but hedge funds were a foreign language to him. i almost hate to put it this way, but chris made it look easy and he was successful,  his dad said.of course, it was not easy. callahan expressed doubts to ngo at the outset about whether investors would take a 20-something-year-old seriously. she disagreed. i had full confidence in chris,  she said.he was loyal, reliable, a meticulous planner, intentional, hyper-organized and funny, qualities that made him the key cog at the centre of a disparate group of friends featuring some big personalities who ensured everybody got along, jesse foden, one of those friends, said. chris and i talked every day,  he said.  he was the friend you could call at 2 a.m. when your car broke down by the side of the road and he would say,  sit tight, i will be there in 10 minutes to pick you up.  callahan was also the friend who could take a complex subject, say, a hedge fund, and break it down into digestible bits, leaving a listener with the belief that he would produce results. it is what had made him a good salesperson, but selling was only part of his appeal.article contentngo met callahan in 2017 at a party in ontario cottage country. saturday morning was their cherished time, an opportunity to enjoy a perfectly slow day, grab a bite of breakfast at callahan s go-to in st. lawrence market and then walk for hours along toronto s waterfront while discussing their hopes, dreams and future.she credits callahan for teaching her to be more assertive at work, to ask for what she deserved in terms of salary and to understand that giving a presentation to a room full of senior executives as a junior person does not mean you do not belong in the room; it is an opportunity to own it. chris taught me how to dream bigger,  ngo, a program manager at google llc, said.she taught him that if he wanted to start a hedge fund, he should go for it and that the rest of the pieces and investor money would fall into place. callahan got going, and he regularly clocked 100-hour workweeks as the nascent fund gained momentum and began generating buzz among the monied crowd.he was on his way, and he would pack extra computer monitors in his checked airline baggage when he and ngo managed to get away for the odd weekend so that he could replicate his trading setup in their hotel room.as the founder of a startup, he wore several hats, and he was aware of traynor ridge s structural shortcomings. a few years after the fund s inception, he approached furse to ask whether he would lead an effort to professionalize the company s structure, put together a board of governors and serve as its chair. callahan wanted to take the fund to the  next level,  his former boss said.article contentfurse was happy to take on the project. they were in the early stages of working through that process in the summer of 2023 when something changed. he knew from their conversations that callahan was having difficulty with some investors and he had confided that he was afraid they were going to pull out of the fund. but he expressed an even deeper fear to his family members, claiming some investors were telling him that if he did not turn things around, his career on bay street would be over. these are nasty people,  his brother said.furse offered some friendly advice and did what he could in terms of mentorship, but he did not know what to make of it when callahan stopped returning his calls and emails. the complexion of our relationship, or the tenor of the conversations, the context, the whole thing just definitely shifted and i could feel that shift   and it was quite unusual   and maybe this is part of the takeaway, at least from my perspective, i just wish that we would have been able to stay in communication,  he said.the fund that claimed top prize in the market neutral category at the 2023 canadian hedge fund awards for having the best three-year risk-adjusted return and second place for the best three-year return was struggling by the end of june to sustain its momentum and was down almost five per cent for the year, according to fundata canada inc., an investment analytics provider.article contentarticle contentfailure is not exclusive to the young or the small in hedge fund circles. acclaimed investor bill ackman, founder of pershing square capital management lp, once reportedly lost us$4 billion on a single company, but one advantage he has compared to newcomers is a long track record.photo by patrick t. fallon/afp via getty imagesexperiencing growing pains is not exclusive to the young or the small in hedge fund circles, and neither is failure. long-term capital management lp, a us$3.6-billion fund that employed a couple of nobel prize winners amongst other seasoned wall street hands, once lost us$553 million in a single day in 1998 and required bailing out by a consortium of american and european banks to prevent a widespread global market panic.ackman once reportedly lost us$4 billion on valeant pharmaceuticals inc., a laval, que.-based drugmaker that went from a national success to a cautionary tale amidst a host of criminal investigations. but one advantage an ackman has compared to hedge fund newcomers is a long track record. no matter how popular algorithm-driven trading has become, it is still a relationship-based industry, and investors may be more inclined to stick with a proven winner even when they are going through a bad patch. hedge funds are a lot of relationship understanding, and relationships are the thing that s going to help you manage through market turbulence,  susan christoffersen, a dean at the university of toronto rotman school of management, said.  people have those long-term relationships with investors to sort of say,  hey, i need you to stick in here for a period of time,  and as a young kid, that would be hard, i imagine. article contentengulfed by a crisis, callahan ran out of time as some of his investors ran out of patience, but he may have been right in the long run about cannabis. united states presidentdonald trumprecently touted the medicinal benefits of cannabidiol for seniors on his truth social platform and in august said his administration was looking at reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug. that led a canaccord genuity group inc. analyst in october to rate several cannabis stocks as buys.but in 2023, few people were buying in. callahan s investor relationships were barely out of the honeymoon phase, and as a bad month became two, three and more and his investors started getting antsy, his solution was to dig in and work even harder. some nights he barely slept. the self-confident powerhouse ngo knew started second-guessing himself. chris had always been able to roll with the punches,  she said.at some point, the bruises piled up.alone and searchingngo enjoyed watching the television show billions, which is about a new york hedge fund manager. callahan was less enthusiastic. one of the central characters is a performance coach who tends to trader psyches, gets to know their fears and digs them out of mental ruts by getting at the root of what might be holding them back.article contentthe show is fictional, but performance coaches are not. denise shull, a former trader on the chicago mercantile exchange, is arguably the godmother of the profession, having been at it for 25 years. she claims some of the biggest names in the hedge fund universe   names she can t mention   as clients since even the highest flyers in finance are all too human. i just got off the phone with a successful portfolio manager,  she said.  he is an eldest child, and eldest children tend to feel the weight of responsibility on their shoulders. making a living making market decisions is the hardest mental game there isdenise shull, a former trader on the chicago mercantile exchange and now performance coachoriginally from ohio, shull moved to utah from manhattan during the pandemic, but she occasionally still dips her toe back in new york. i know people will object to me saying this, but making a living making market decisions is the hardest mental game there is,  she said.  it may not be working as a hospice nurse, which is very emotionally difficult and taxing, but the phenomenon of having to make a market decision where the game never ends, where you can be wrong but right, and you can make a case for either way given the ambiguity of it, is harder than chess or even poker. the kicker? judgment gets handed down at daily market close; either you have won the game or you are a loser, but the game begins anew soon enough. shull has clients in their 50s who have lived through booms, busts and daily setbacks, and they are not overly troubled by whatever the next storm ahead may be. but she said most of her clients are afraid of  failure most of the time and for some, the fear is mild, but for others, it is existential. article contentalden cass, a new york-based psychologist and performance coach, authored a pioneering late 1990s academic study on mental health among stockbrokers when markets were soaring and they were getting rich. despite being on a bull run, 23 per cent of respondents exhibited clinically diagnosable levels of major depression, emotional exhaustion and burnout.what he has learned through his experience working with hedge fund traders is that they tend to be perfectionists and when things get stressful, they  avoid focusing on their internal self, and they focus only on getting out of the hole, and that becomes an obsession, to get out of that hole, to not fail. and they won t and they don t go for the necessary help with their stress, because they don t feel that they have the time. cass said it is common for new york-based hedge funds to employ a dedicated risk manager whose job is to analyze risks holistically, from the trades being made to issues around compliance, scanning the environment for any potential landmines that could lead to a fund s undoing.neither shull nor cass can speak directly to callahan s situation, but what ngo took away from watching billions is that her partner needed a coach. she could not find any options in toronto, though there were plenty of names to choose from in new york, but it didn t seem to register when she floated the idea of connecting him with someone external to work with.article content chris didn t have the time or didn t want to prioritize getting that kind of support,  she said.asking for help is not easy, said john oliffe, a professor, founder and lead investigator of the university of british columbia s men s health research program. what he has learned over the years is that men possess an uncanny ability to conceal their internal struggles and often do not have the language to articulate, in real terms, the level of the strain they may be under. it typically tends to be late in the game when men do ask for help. guys look internally; they try to solve the problem and they keep it quiet,  he said.compounding the risk for callahan may have been his occupation. when you are winning, it is a lot easier to get to the end of the day and enjoy and celebrate it, but if you re still going through that stressful environment and coming out, having lost in the way they count it in the finance industry, then it is going to start to chip away at you,  oliffe said.callahan started winning out of the gate. traynor ridge posted returns of about 40 per cent and 24 per cent in its first two years, respectively, and eked out a small gain in 2022 despite global markets falling close to 20 per cent that year.article contentthe wins, however, are never guaranteed, as darroch pointed out. the retired professor has worked with a lot of finance executives and met his share of traders, and what they taught him is that unless someone has managed through a tough market, they are not prepared for it and they  may end up taking too many risks.  people also tend to repeat their successes  until the failures become too big to ignore, and by then, sometimes it is too late,  he said.ngo grew increasingly worried about her partner as october wore on. callahan begged off seeing her for a time after thanksgiving, claiming he was too busy. eventually, she showed up at his office in his townhouse, and, sure enough, he was working alongside an employee in the spotlessly tidy space with a desk, three computer screens and a picture of tiger woods, his idol, on the wall.virtu emailed callahan at 6:34 p.m. on oct. 23 to advise him that the  failed trades would be sold out  as early as the next day, according to court filings.the dominos rapidly fell thereafter as other brokerages that dealt with traynor

echelon wealth partners with approximately $19.8 million in losses, a canadian investment regulatory organization report said.article contentthere was no escaping the situation; traynor ridge was going under. callahan spoke with ngo by phone on the night of oct. 26. he told her he loved her   twice. they planned to get together at his place after work the following day, a friday. he also spoke with his dad, indicating that things were going to be ok with traynor ridge.he met with his colleagues friday morning, but when ngo arrived at his condo at 5 p.m., he was not there and his gun locker had been left open. inside was a letter to her and one to each of his family members. he was found dead later that night in an area north of toronto. everybody survived this, but chris,  his dad said.  the banks that dealt with chris, they are ok; the investors, it is just money. it might be a lot of money, but it is just money. everybody else survived. it took time, but ngo is happy again and thriving in the job she remembers being excited to tell callahan about when she got it. her memories from that october and the weeks after are blurred, but she remains close with his family and is grateful she had the time she did with him. i had never met anyone like chris before and i have never met anyone like him since,  she said.her favourite photo of them together is from a trip to

smaller hedge funds to have a board and encouraging industry experts to serve as mentors and advisers, and creating a better overall system of checks and balances, especially when a young person is

    "text": "scilogs heidelberg laureate forum english a lindau lecture to catalyze the power of chemistry22. oct 2025byandrei mihailesedauer ca. 9 minuten1 commenta lindau lecture to catalyze the power of chemistryblog:heidelberg laureate forumlaureates of mathematics and computer science meet the next generationtheheidelberg laureate forumhas a deep connection to thelindau nobel laureate meetings. every year, the two sister events  swap lectures.  this year, it was david macmillan, a nobel laureate in chemistry, who took the stage at both events, delivering his signature lecture on the power of catalysis. macmillan s lecture explored the intricacies of organic catalysis, a field he helped pioneer, and also offered a glimpse into the future of sustainable chemistry.macmillan presenting his lecture at the 12th hlf. (  hlff / kreutzer)catalysis is everywheremacmillan was awarded thenobel prize for his workonasymmetric organocatalysts, which opened up an entirely new range of chemical reactions. but to understand why macmillan s work is so revolutionary, we have to first look at the previous state of affairs. if you look around you right now, absolutely everything that you can see is made by a chemical reaction,  macmillan says. from the caffeine in your coffee to the screen you are reading this on, chemical reactions are the invisible architects of the modern world. but some reactions need a bit of  help  to take place. this is where catalysis come in.a catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. think of it like a person trying to get home every day by walking over a massive hill. a catalyst is like digging a tunnel through that hill. from that long, complex journey that takes up a lot of energy, you can walk through the hill and get to the destination faster and easier. so, in essence, catalysis lowers the energy required for a reaction to happen, making it faster, more efficient, or even making it possible in the first place.this is not a niche concern. catalysts are essential because many of the chemical reactions needed to create vital products (from plastics and medicines to the fertilizer that grows our food) are naturally so slow that they are practically impossible on a useful timescale. catalysts are so widespread that an estimated 35% of the world s gdpis directly dependent on them, and the number will only gethigher in the future. the most striking example is thehaber-bosch process, a catalytic reaction that converts nitrogen from the air into ammonia for fertilizer. without it, we could not produce enough food to feed the earth s 8 billion people. this process is so widespread that around half of the nitrogen atoms in your body come from synthetic catalysis.for a hundred years, chemists believed they had only two types of catalysts.the first was nature s way: enzymes. these are the catalysts of life, gigantic, intricate proteins that perform every chemical task inside our bodies with remarkable precision. chemists have harnessed enzymesto create various productsand this approach has been widely successful. however, enzymes are often delicate, highly specific, and can be difficult to work with outside of their natural environment.the second, and far more common in industrial chemistry, was the human-invented method: metal catalysis. metalocatalysis relies on metals, which are technically elements from the middle of the periodic table. palladium, rhodium, platinum, and nickel are common examples. these metals are phenomenal catalysts, capable of performing an incredible range of chemical transformations. they are the workhorses that build our plastics, our pharmaceuticals, and our fuels.but they too have a dark side.many of these metals are rare and expensive. palladium, essential for everything from your car s catalytic converter to your smartphone, is a prime example.  we ve been using palladium on earth for about 90 years,  macmillan warns, but we don t have too many years left of palladium on earth. furthermore, these metals are alsofrequently toxic, posing a risk to both human health and the environment. and they are incredibly sensitive. many metal catalysts are instantly destroyed by contact with air or water, forcing chemists to work in cumbersome  glove boxes,  sealed chambers filled with inert gas.so, macmillan looked for a better way.an organic revolution  hlff / flemminga key moment for macmillan started with a question from a graduate student of his. tristan lambert walked up to macmillan and asked about the mechanism of a classic chemical reaction. the laureate walked to the blackboard and started explaining and that was when he realized something.a typical metal catalyst has two parts: a central metal atom (the expensive, toxic, and sensitive part) and a surrounding  organic framework.  this framework is a molecule made mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and other common elements, very common elements. in traditional metal catalysis, this organic part was seen as a mere scaffold to hold the important metal atom in place.staring at the chalk diagram on the board that day, macmillan had his eureka moment. he realized the organic molecule in question briefly formed a special state that looked suspiciously similar to the way metal catalysts worked. if an organic molecule could mimic the electronic action of a complex metal catalyst, even for a moment, then couldn t it be a catalyst on its own?  what if,  he thought,  we just get rid of the metal? why don t we just use the organic part to do the catalysis? this was the birth of asymmetric organocatalysis. the idea was to use small, simple, robust organic molecules to do the work that had previously required rare, precious metals. these were molecules that are non-toxic, insensitive to air and water, and completely sustainable. it was, in theory, a perfect solution.the first test was a big one. macmillan and his students decided to try their idea on one of the most famous and powerful reactions in all of chemistry: thediels-alder reaction, a cornerstone of molecular construction so important its discoverers won the nobel prize in 1950. they took two simple starting materials, added a small amount of a simple organic molecule as their proposed catalyst, and mixed them.it worked perfectly. i always remember getting this result,  macmillan recounts with a laugh.  i walked in my office, i closed the door and locked the door. i closed the blinds. then i jumped up and down for about 10 minutes. i was so excited. i remember calling my wife and i said to my wife,  i think we re going to get tenure!' a new way to do chemistrymacmillan realized he was on to something remarkable. but in his first scientific paper, he made a bold, almost reckless, proclamation. he argued this wasn t just a one-off trick that worked for a single reaction. he claimed it was a  generic activation mode,  a general principle that should work for hundreds of different reactions.the only problem was, he could not replicate it in other reactions. this was our first-generation catalyst. we said it s going to work for hundreds of reactions. it went bang, bang, bang   nothing,  he says.  we tried it on three reactions, and then it just stopped.  the catalyst that worked so beautifully for the diels-alder reaction was a dud for everything else.  in this moment, i m starting to have panic attacks. i ve just told the world this is going to work for hundreds of reactions. we ve got three. yet again, key inspiration came from graduate students, who suggested a subtle but critical change to the catalyst s structure. it was a bit of  precision molecular engineering.  macmillan compares it to a spectacular goal scored against england byzlatan ibrahimovic. it s a goal of sublime, almost impossible precision. the new catalyst, like that goal, was engineered for perfection.when they tried it, the floodgates opened.  bang,  macmillan says,  they started to really work.  soon, labs around the world jumped in, designing new organocatalysts, and the field exploded.the impact has been enormous. in everything from fragrances to drugs, organocatalysis is now beingroutinely used. for macmillan, seeing his chemistry used to create a medicine that helps millions was a  wonderful  moment.perhaps the most profound impact, however, was one he never anticipated. because the catalysts are so cheap, stable, and easy to use, they don t require expensive equipment or facilities. this has led to what macmillan calls the  democratization of catalysis.  for the first time, cutting-edge chemical research could be performed not just in the elite labs of the western world, but on every continent. when people ask me,  what is the next big idea coming from catalysis? ,  he says,  i say,  number one, i don t know. but the second thing is, i know it s not going to be based on who has the most money but rather on who has the best idea.'  for someone with his values, he says,  that is something which is really, really cool. chemistry in a new lightafter explaining his nobel-winning work, macmillan continued with something that he considers just as promising, if not more.after establishing organocatalysis as the third great pillar of the field, macmillan s restless mind turned to a new challenge. this time, he says, the idea was  completely stolen  from a different group of scientists altogether: inorganic chemists who were trying to harness solar energy to power the planet.their work involved materials that could absorb visible light. macmillan wondered if he could take their light-absorbing molecules and merge them with the world of catalysis. this gave rise to a second new field called photoredox catalysis.most organic molecules are colorless; they don t interact with visible light. however, the special photoredox catalysts, often containing a metal atom like iridium or ruthenium, are brightly colored. they act like tiny antennas, specifically designed to absorb the energy from a photon of light like a simple led.when the catalyst absorbs that blue light, it enters a highly energized, excited state. macmillan explains the magnitude of this energy boost with a jaw-dropping analogy:  it basically is the equivalent of being at 32,000 degrees celsius, while every other molecule in the vessel is still at room temperature.  the catalyst now has a massive surplus of energy, and it is desperate to get rid of it. it does this by either giving an electron to, or snatching one from, a nearby molecule.this act of electron transfer flips a switch on otherwise inert, unreactive molecules, turning them into highly reactive molecules. suddenly, chemists could use simple blue light to activate vast classes of abundant, everyday chemicals that were previously thought to be unusable.the implications areespecially importantfor medicine, enabling researchers to limit the side effects of drugs in the body and create drug candidates with much higher specificity and precision. this branch is now also used routinely by pharmaceutical companies.david macmillan s engaging lecture is a reminder that sometimes, even the most groundbreaking of discoveries start with a blackboard and a seemingly simple question. his work gave chemistry a greener, cheaper, and more democratic way to help build the world. as we face global challenges like climate change and disease, his work is a powerful reminder that the next world-changing idea might just be a matter of looking at an old problem and seeing it in a completely new light.posted byandrei mihaiandrei is a science communicator and a phd candidate in geophysics. he is the co-founder of zme science, where he published over 2,000 articles. andrei tries to blend two things he loves (science and good stories) to make the world a better place -- one article at a time."

the first washis speechat the podium to a crowd of international leaders, where he called for the creation of a un army to liberate palestine and denounced us attempts to intervene in venezuela and colombia.following his speech, headdresseda gathering of pro-palestinian protesters and journalists outside the un building using a megaphone, where he urged us soldiers to disobey president donald trump s orders. his exact words were:the people united will never be defeated. we are going to present a resolution ordering the united nations to form an army to save the world, whose first task will be to liberate palestine. from here, from new york, i ask all soldiers in the us army not to point their guns at humanity. disobey trump s orders, obey the orders of humanity.washington responds: visa revocation and diplomatic falloutin response, the us state department announced onxthat it wasrevokingpetro s visa due to his  reckless and incendiary actions.  this is the second time a colombian president has had his visa revoked by the us. the first wasernesto samperduring former us president bill clinton s first term in 1996, due to his alleged connection to the cali drug cartel and colombia s refusal to extradite drug traffickers. in august 2025, arturo arias, the ex-president of costa rica and nobel peace prize laureate,statedthat the us had canceled his visa after he voiced his criticism of trump on the internet.petro s visa cancellation appears to have added him to the list of current or former presidents banned from entering the us. this list also includes mahmoud abbas, the palestinian president, who was unable to attend the un assembly for thissame reason.a fractured relationship: colombia and the united states through historythe revocation of petro s visa is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the united states  decades-long challenging relationship with colombia, a pivotal nation in the south american political landscape. this relationship is typically portrayed by endeavors to combat drug trafficking, the contradictory romanticization of figures like pablo escobar by popular culture   as depicted in the netflix seriesnarcos  and the cloaking of the shared history of north and south american decolonial struggles for independence and the contributions of figures like gabriel garc a m rquez (the colombian nobel prize winner in literature in 1982 and author ofone hundred years of solitude[1967]).more specifically, setting aside magical realism, the relationship between petro and trump has been brief yet intense, and it has been defined by a series of mutual accusations that began in january of this year.petro initially rejected two planes carrying colombian deportees, arguing that they were not receiving dignified treatment. however, the two countries later reached anagreementamid threats of tariffs.petro s rhetoric of resistance and the echo of bol varpetro chosexto address the us president directly. in this missive, which begins with a confessional tone, he writes:trump, i don t really like traveling to the us. it s boring, but i must admit that there are some good things about it   i don t like your oil, trump. you re going to destroy the human race because of your greed. maybe someday, over a glass of whiskey, which i accept despite my gastritis, we can talk frankly about this. but it s difficult because you consider me inferior, and i m not, nor is any colombian.in his lengthy letter, petro suggests taking a historical journey and recalls theus interventionagainst chilean president salvador allende, which elevated augusto pinochet to power. he appears to be defending colombia s global standing, highlighting aspects such as  colombia is the heart of the world, and you misunderstood that. this is the land of yellow butterflies, the land of remedios  beauty,  drawing a literary parallel to one of the most stunning scenes inone hundred years of solitude.among other references to the past struggles of the us civil rights movement, petro contradicts his willingness to share a whiskey with trump when he adds,  i do not shake hands with white slave owners. i shake hands with white libertarians, the heirs of lincoln, and black and white peasant boys of the united states. in this x message, petro uses the plural form of  americas,  making it clear that colombia will no longer look northward. he also mentions venezuelan statesman and military officer sim n bol var (1783 1830), the hero of south american independence   also known asel libertador,  the liberator    highlighting the shared, collective and plurinational history of the americas, which he believes trump does not represent.he draws attention to trump s immigrant past and lack of native american ancestry, referring to him as an  immigrant  as well:  i raise a flag and, as gait n said, even if i am alone, it will continue to fly with latin american dignity, which is the dignity of america, which your great-grandfather did not know, but mine did, mr. president, immigrant in the united states. although several months had passed and the scenario was different, petro maintained the core sentiment of his aforementioned x epistle when he addressed the un general assembly.his speechwas equally assertive and combative.climate, conflict and calls for a new world orderhe addressedstatementsmade by the us government one week prior to the assembly, in which they claimed that neither venezuela nor colombia was cooperating in the fight against drug trafficking.these statements were made amid thesensitive situationinvolving the us troops  launch of a missile at a small boat in caribbean waters in early september. the us alleged that the ship was trafficking drugs. standing before the un, petrosharedthat an investigation was underway to determine if colombian civilians were aboard the boat. he stressed the importance of initiating due process against the us officials who ordered the missile strike.from the podium, petro provocatively proposed that  drug traffickers live elsewhere. they live in new york, a few blocks away, and in miami. they make deals with the dea. they live in luxury, not poverty. not in the caribbean or gaza. the colombian president also devoted much of his speech to discussing the climate crisis and clean energies, such as green hydrogen and decarbonization. he praised the  enormous absorbent sponge of the amazon rainforest . he also accused the  most powerful government in the world  of not believing in science:  that is called irrationalism, and it was that same irrationalism that filled hitler s germany. when it was his turn, trump devoted a significant portion ofhis addressto the unga to criticizing renewable energy and rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change. he claimed that clean energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are less effective and more expensive than fossil fuel alternatives.speaking from the un podium, petro adopted the tone of the latin american independence heroes he mentioned in his january letter when he proposed the creation of a un armed force. he made statements such as,  there is no superior race, gentlemen. there are no chosen people of god. neither the united states nor israel are chosen by god. ignorant fundamentalists of the extreme right think that way. the chosen people of god are all of humanity. after this, he added that diplomacy had run its course and urged the un to establish an armed force to protect the lives of palestinians:  words are no longer enough. it is time for bol var s sword of liberty or death because they are not only going to bomb gaza and the caribbean, they already are, they are attacking humanity, which cries out for freedom. from bol var s dream to a divided continentin addition to his defiant tone toward trump and his call for the us military to rebel against him, petro s recent public statements are notable for their repeated mention of bol var. during his visit to new york, he granted aninterviewto thebbc news worldbased in manhattan. the words chosen for the headline of the interview s video were  trump has failed to understand that bol var s children are not subordinates. bol var, the  liberator of america,  fought against the spanish crown for 20 years to achieve independence for bolivia, colombia, ecuador, peru and venezuela. born in caracas to a family of creole nobility, bol var received a european education. he then brought what he had learned about liberation in france to the other side of the ocean.in august 1819, bol var crossed the andes mountain range and defeated spanish troops in thebattle of boyac , achieving independence for the region of new granada, now colombia. interestingly, in 1691, palenque, located in present-day colombia, was the first colonial settlement tofreeafrican slaves, who became the first officially freed black slaves anywhere in the americas.one of bol var s greatest hopes was a grand confederation of all the former spanish colonies in america, inspired by the united states  model. to this end, in 1826, he convened thecongress of panamato organize a confederation of american nations that would support and cooperate with each other for the common good. however, as we know, he did not achieve his goal.nowadays, the differences among countries in the region continue. in the current state of affairs, trump is favored by ecuadorian presidentdaniel noboaand argentine presidentjavier milei,who distance themselves from other regional leaders, such as chilean presidentgabriel boricand venezuelan president nicol s maduro, who oppose us interventionism.domestic backlash and regional uncertainty2026 will be a pivotal year for south american politics, with upcoming presidential elections in countries such as peru, brazil and colombia. a map that has always been of strategic imperial interest to the united states, as evidenced by its long history of interventions in regime changes. according to theharvard review of latin america,  in the slightly less than a hundred years from 1898 to 1994, the us government has intervened successfully to change governments in latin america a total of at least 41 times. since the late 20th century, the international relations between colombia and the united states have been marked by bilateral efforts against drug trafficking, such as theplan colombia, signed in 1999 between the administrations of colombian president andr s pastrana arango and clinton, who signed it into us law as an approval of an aid package to both keep drugs outside the us shores and  help colombia promote peace and prosperity and deepen its democracy. a fundamental aspect of the plan colombia was indeed supportingthe disarmamentof the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc), the country s largest insurgent group, founded in the 1960s, and the national liberation army (eln), both designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the us state department. lvaro uribe, elected colombian president in 2010, began formal peace talks with the farc in 2012. it wasn t until us presidentbarack obama sand colombian president juan manuel santos s terms that the peace process actually reached its culmination in colombia, after only four rounds of negotiations, and with the governments of chile, cuba, norway and venezuela as hosts, mediators and observers.the peace agreement called for the guerrillas to hand over their weapons to a un commission. it also contemplated that international aid, especially from the united states, would be needed to invest in neglected rural areas and create economic alternatives to drug trafficking.unlike the farc,the elnremains active, particularly along the colombia-venezuela border. during his presidency, petro has pursued the idea of achieving  total peace  by disarming the eln. however, negotiationsbroke downin july after the eln attacked civilians in the catatumbo border region.due to its involvement inillegal economies, peasant agriculture and the centuries-long indigenous struggle for land sovereignty, it seems that the eln continues to hold significantsocial power.returning to petro s controversial visit to new york, during thebbc news worldinterview, journalist tom bateman asked petro,  are you concerned that taking this approach of resisting the us administration risks further isolating your country?  petro responded that he believes it is president trump who is isolating himself from the world regarding his position on the palestinian genocide.however, a quick review of mainstream colombian media shows the opposite: the president is facing fierce opposition in his own country. journalist daniel coronellclaimsthat petro is  building his pedestal as a martyr  and  dragging colombia down with him. former foreign minister juan carlos pinz ntoldthe colombian media outletsemana,  this country does not need clowns.  pinz n, who is presenting himself as a potential presidential candidate and former ambassador to the united states, also said,  we will resolve the issue with

    "text": "our so-called  food system  is a complete mess, one that must be set to rights if the people are to have a chance of thriving in the coming years, which are likely to be stressful because of other messes. this dire situation has been described infood fight: from plunder and profit to people and planetby stuart gillispie (september 2025). this book will live up to its blurbs, from chris van tulleken, for example,  the essential food book of this year and years to come,  whoseultra-processed people: the science behind foodthat isn t food, was discussed here inmarch 2024. as marion nestle points out, gillispie s focus on the international food system is natural, given that he has been working on international nutrition for more than forty years. he begins with this:the problem we face now is the simple fact that our global food system is an anachronism. in the last century it has performed miracles [1], but in this one it s a source of jeopardy.we should not speak of reform and repair, because it s not actually broken.the system we have is working just the way those who control it want it to work. for capitalism to sustain itself, it needs to generate (continually increasing) profit (through growth instead of development). and in 2025,after nearly fifty years of neoliberalism, the most profitable food system is the one that manufactures ultra-processed products which are marketed aggressively across the world.throughoutfood fight, gillispie demonstrates how:the global food system has itself become a large part of the problem (of a persistent if well camouflaged colonialism from our perspective), having been captured by transnational corporations who profit from public ill-health while using an array of tactics to stop government (and the people such as they have any agency) from getting in their way.the main problem with our current food system is that those who are caught up in it (poor and rich alike) are at the same time undernourished and overfed. thus, we have an obesity epidemic that has penetrated every part of the world, while at the same time producing malnourished people at a large profit. research has shown that undernutrition in the early stages of life causes physiological damage and aftereffects that potentiate obesity later in life. this is a virtuous cycle only for the purveyors of poor but tasty, and habit-forming if not addictive in the clinical sense, food-like substances. earlier books on this subject includefast food nation: the dark side of the americanmeal (2001) by eric schlosser andsalt, sugar, fat: how the food giants hooked us(2014) by michael moss, along the essential work ofmarion nestle(pronounced  ne-sel ).perhaps the first modern food fight is exemplified by nestl , theswiss corporation( good food, good life ) that brings us thekit-katalong with other delectable delights. in 1867henri nestl developed a  formula  to mimic human milk. a hundred years later the eponymous transnational corporation sent sales representatives dressed as nurses into what at the time was inelegantly called the third world, where:they promoted formula foods as a replacement for breast milk. mothers were provided with one free can when they left the hospital   a potentially lethal freebie. most mothers lived where the water was not safe, where the feed could easily be contaminated in preparation lead to diarrhea, dehydration and often death. bottles were not sterilized. mothers would over dilute the formula which meant the newborn was not able to absorb the nutrients after starting the baby of formula they couldn t switch back to breastfeeding   it was too late in the lactation cycle.no wonder thenestl  boycottthat began in 1977 continues, albeit without apparent effect, in 2025. the handiwork of big food:in a 2018 study, thenational bureau of economic research(nber) estimated that 10,870,000 infants had died between 1960 and 2015 as a result of nestl  baby formula used by  mothers [inlow and middle-income countries] without clean water sources , with deaths peaking at 212,000 in 1981 (seemortality from nestl  s marketing of infant formula in low and middle-income countries, pdf).in 2024, a report by swiss nonprofitpublic eyeand ibfan stated thatnestl  adds more sugar to baby food sold in lower- and middle-income countriescompared to healthier versions sold in affluent.and as gillispie puts it, the jump from this firstfood fightto the subsequentfake food floodwas a natural progression. baby formula is an ultra-processed food (upf), and the food science used to produce it was adapted to produce  food  for children and adults with alacrity, initially with breakfast cereals and later with the modern ultra-processed manufactured items that fill the central aisles of the typical supermarket in row after row after row of ersatz abundance.the nova system to characterize ultra-processed food was developed by carlos monteiro of the university of s o paulo:group 1: unprocessed or minimally processed (e.g., frozen vegetables)group 2: oils, butter, lard, sugar, salt derived from group 1 foods or from nature by pressing, refining, grinding, milling, or dryinggroup 3: foods processed by adding group 2 ingredients to group 1 foods (canned vegetables, sauces) [2]group 4: manufactured food-like substancesthe simple definition of upf from gillispie is: upfs are industrially produced foods wrapped in plastic, containing ingredients not available in the home. upf is formula food for all ages. [3] food scientists have developed these by manipulating sugar, salt, and fat to hit the bliss point of taste and mouthfeel. they are really quite remarkable. speaking from recent weak-minded experience, a nabiscopinwheelis the perfect synthetic food-like drug. nova 4 products are not meant to nourish people, but they are delicious.ultra-processing also allows manufacturers to alter their products in virtually unlimited ways. reliance on a few crops (e.g., maize, wheat, soy) is not a barrier to big food when these feedstocks, the exact analog of oil and natural gas as industrial feedstocks for plastic and fertilizer manufacturers, are so changeable. these few basic materials can be  transformed into a kaleidoscope of products with different shapes, size, colors, tastes, flavors, smells, textures,  limited only by the imagination and techniques of food scientists upfs are really profit-generators disguises as food.  gains are privatized and costs in environmental degradation, illness, and disease are socialized. and most remarkably:in 2022, nestl  acknowledged that most of its products weren t healthy and never will be. in april 2024, nine out of ten shareholders at the annual general meeting in lausanne voted to continue to prioritize unhealthy foods.or maybe this is not remarkable at all. shareholder value is only a trope invented bymilton friedmanin an article in thenew york times magazine in 1970. but its foul myth has become another feral fact, along with  growth must be pursued at all costs  in a finite ecosphere, belying the notion that capitalism can be  reformed. the virtuous corporate cycle continues.  diet  upfs have become an antidote to upf-induced disease:the stratospheric popularity of glp-1 agonists such as ozempic and wegovy has provided yet another example of industry capturing new markets created by the harms of their products. as users report cravings of protein-rich products in smaller portions to reduce gastrointestinal (gi) side effects, the industry is innovating to provide them what they need (in) a brand-new market estimated to reach 15 million people by 2030. in may 2024, nestl  announcedvital pursuit, a new line of frozen, high-protein foods.  we want to be there for every moment of our consumers  lives   today and in the future,  said steve presley, ceo, nestl  north america.so, to simplify, but not by much: upfs led to the obesity epidemic, virtually everywhere in the world. glp-1 agonists are then developed to help those who can afford them lose weight. but while doing so these people who are living withsociogenic obesityneedhigh-protein upf ready-to-eat  meals to lessen their gi discomfort (one can only marvel at the name of this website:  goodnes.com ). these new upfs are provided by the original upf manufacturers. this is the perfect progression of modern capitalism in the form of an industrial, ever-growing, self-licking ice cream cone (naturally, the ice cream and the cone are upfs).the consequences of our upf addiction are also maladaptive in other parts of the ecosphere. our current food system presents us with a bleak landscape filled with food swamps and food deserts. afood desertis an area where finding any healthy food is a challenge. [4] afood swampis an area inundated with outlets selling calorie-dense, ultra-processed junk and fast-food intended to be eaten on the street or in the car. these food swamps are often healthy food deserts.food swamps filled with upfs are also environmental nightmares:ultra-processed foods account for 30-50 percent of diet-related energy use, biodiversity loss, greenhouse-gas emissions, land use, food waste, and water use. emissions from upfs increased by 245% between 1987 and 2018. nestl  s emissions are three times those of its host country, switzerland. [5]two of the largest environmental culprits in the upf business arepalm oiland soy, feedstocks of the category error that is industrial agriculture. palm oil is used to increase their caloric load and to stabilize upfs (saturated fats are solid at room temperature). during the last fifty years more than half of the virgin rainforest in indonesia has been destroyed to produce palm oil. soy is used to feed livestock (for example incafosandfeedlots):at over 40 per cent protein, soy is ideal for bulk-feeding animals. soy protein isolate is used to improve  mouthfeel  in upfs and to allow the product to be marketed as high in protein. in the meat, fish, cheese, eggs and milk we eat and drink in the uk, we re effectively consuming over 60kg of soy every year that comes from a wales-sized chunk of land carved out of the amazon rain forest.the three major consequences by big food s upf production are (1) loss of agrobiodiversity and soil health caused by the industrial production,notfarming, of wheat, soy, and maize; (2) destruction of water sources for the production of upfs, including fizzy drinks and bottled water; and (3) plastic pollution. none of these problems needs further elaboration, but the key point is also the primary reason that capitalism  works : negative externality  is bloodless economist-speak for the price to be paid for capitalist economic growth. a price to be paid not by the employer, but those who couldn t insulate themselves from it by living elsewhere. unintended and hidden consequences that are not reflected in prices paid by consumers or received by producers.by ignoring externalities, market prices of foods are delinked from the true cost of production. the more costly production of healthier, more sustainable foods becomes less profitable for farmers and food businesses than the production of unhealthy food that has lower direct costs but much greater externalities.food systems are now destroying much more value than they create.this is not a problem with only the food system, but in the words of the author,nil desperandum!despair not, there is reason to hope. the high costs associated with the food system, us$15 trillion per year, including $11 trillion in health costs associated with malnutrition, point to a potential payoff that is unimaginably large even if it is overestimated by 50%, if only we could fix the food system. this is covered inthe economics of the food system transformation(2024, pdf).which brings us to how this transformation might be accomplished. but it is essential to remember that business per se is not the problem. instead, a near monopoly held by a handful of transnational corporations of neoliberal late capitalism is the problem:private sector is not a helpful term for us here: it s way too broad. we need to distinguish small- and medium sized enterprises that could collaborate in the social change process from the giants that derive their power from peddling junk food.nor does the solution like in public-private partnerships, because there is always incompatibility between a private interest and a public duty for-profit corporations have a conflict of interest when they engage in public governance.this will always be true, just as it is for big philanthropy, which is neocolonialism on steroids. we as a citizens of the world must learn to ignore the  dark arts  of the persuaders and merchants of doubt. this will require the removal of money from our  electoral democracy  in which one dollar equals one vote. at the moment this is unimaginable, but we can proceed with a thought experiment that assumes a true democracy of one citizen-one vote. our solution will not rely on the transnational  private sector,  which is not private and will never be democratic.gillispie s focus is international, as befits a global catastrophe of neocolonialism. however, the end of this food fight will not come from big food or big philanthropy, such as the rockefeller/gatesalliance for a green revolution in africa (agra). the solution must come from below instead of above, the world over. it is a mistake to view colonialism that happens only in the periphery   africa, south asia, south america. colonialism happens in the global north, too.for example, the former rural culture of norfolk, where most of the fresh produce in the uk is grown has been supplanted by big ag, is a colony. the same is true in theamerican south,which has been a colony since before the american civil war, and the american midwest and great plains, which became colonies slightly later. in each of these colonies, commodity crops are produced, not farmed, for the benefit of big ag and big food instead of the people.in any case, food cannot be  global,  despite its commoditization in the global trade. food can only be local. if we, again as citizens of the world, focus on the colonies closest to home and revive local and regional culture and foodways, the problems of an unhealthy but very profitable global food system that ignores negative externalities will dissipate and eventually disappear as big food shrinks into oblivion. yes, a thought experiment.still, we must figure out a way to sustainably and profitably produce food for use. [6] this can be done, perhaps through the lens provided by mariana mazzucato inmission economy, where her plan is to mend capitalism rather than end it. a better approach might be found in kate raworth sdoughnut economics, which seeks  to create a balance between the needs of the people  and planet earth. some would prefer that we simply pay attention toherman dalyand startdevelopinga better lifeinstead of growingour way further into polycrisis.but whatever we do, andfood fightis a very good place to begin to plan, it will be different in the coming smaller world as the climate changes and real needs are addressed of necessity.eating will be an agricultural actonce again, without the need of industrial  farms  mono-cropped in maize, wheat, or soy that extend beyond the horizon, and the feedlots that use their products.notes[1] primarily in the form of the so-called green revolution, for whichnorman borlaugwas awarded the nobel peace prize in 1970. the green revolution was a success by the metrics used in the 1960s. but the eclipse of indigenous and regional agriculture by unaccountable transnational corporations engaged in industrial agriculture was not sustainable, except as a wealth-taking enterprise that continued colonialism in an ostensibly benign form. modern hybrid seeds did not improve nutritional status even as they increased productivity by conventional measures.[2] the michaels of brooklyn  fresh tomato & basil  sauce in my pantry that contains only tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh garlic, italian olive oil, salt, black pepper and fresh parsley is a group 3 food. it is good enough (i have no desire to imitatestanley tucci, yet) and was purchased at a localfresh market, which simulates an old-fashioned market in that everything is not pre-packaged and wrapped in plastic, including at the meat counter. the fresh market is more pleasant than publix, kroger, heb, or safeway, and marginally more expensive. conventional sauces with extenders, chemical preservatives, palm oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and the like are nova group 4.[3] nova 4 includes fizzy drinks; packaged snacks; chocolate, ice cream; mass-produced packaged breads and buns; margarines; biscuits, cookies, pastries, breakfast cereals, energy bars; energy drinks, fruit yoghurts. also, pre-prepared ready-to-heat pies, pasta, pizza; chicken nuggets; pre-cooked meatballs; powdered and packaged instant foods; meal replacement shakes and powders. these industrial products take up most of the space in the typical american supermarket. none of them is healthy or nutritious. all of them are manufactured to taste good and feel good. when the occasional nova 4 item is considered a treat, all remains right with the world (e.g., the6.5-ounce reusable glass bottle of coca-cola of my childhood). but upfs have become dietary staples. and thepause that refreshes(ignore the ai-generated workslop at the top of the page) has become a 32-ounce, or larger, big gulp instead of that pause.[4] on more than one occasion i have needed to remind a medical student that thousands of people within a few miles of our building live in food deserts where the only thing on offer at the independent  convenience  stores and bodegas are beer, other non-alcoholic fizzy drinks, upf snacks and ready-to-eat microwavable meals, cigarettes, and lottery tickets. local public transit might be a four-hour round trip to a supermarket for our fellow citizens. the people in these neighborhoods are afflicted with the usual consequences of our food system: malnourishment from being undernourished but overfed, along with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, the latter three usually undiagnosed. the same goes for those at the local country club, too, where most of the shirts for sale in the pro shop are xl and xxl, with a few xxl. ozempic has become very popular in those circles.[5] while readingfood fight, i paid close attention to the references and sources cited. they seem sound throughout. the references supporting these environmental conclusions can be foundhere,here, andhere. they are convincing. the only  scholars  who dispute the obesity epidemic, plastic pollution, profligate natural resource (water) and energy use, and the consequences of anthropogenic climate change are the usual economists andmerchants of doubtalong with the occasionaladventitious nobel laureatewho maintains that anthropogenic global warming will not really have much of a deleterious effect on the economy. but see the business of property and casualty insurance, florida and california divisions; my homeowner s insurance has increased by 80% in the last 6-7 years despite making only one claim, far away from either state, for roof damage caused by a hailstorm, in 37 years.[6] profitable for the farmer, the grocer, the rancher, and the trucker instead of the shareholders and executives of nestl  and similar big food transnationals."

    "text": "alright, i m gonna make a $5 bet here to every euro car guy. you ve memorized every bmw m model s 0-60 time, you can pronounce  n rburgring  without sounding like you re choking on a pretzel, and you ve probably got strong opinions about whether the 911 turbo s or gt3 rs is the  real  porsche. but here s the thing   while you ve been busy arguing about which german engineering marvel deserves your retirement fund, the rest of europe has been quietly building some absolutely mental machines.from italian lunatics who think  reliability  is a swear word, to british madmen who believe comfort is optional if the steering feel is telepathic, these 12 cars prove that automotive excellence doesn t always come with a side of sauerkraut.breaking away from the german moldimage credit: lotus.selecting the best non-german europeanperformance carsisn t about rejecting german excellence (we re not complete idiots here). it s about celebrating the beautiful chaos that happens when other european nations decide to build something fast. these cars make you question why you ever thought a sensible all-wheel-drive system was more important than hearing your exhaust note echo off canyon walls.we re talking about cars with character flaws that somehow make them more lovable, not less. cars built by people who clearly failed the  practical engineering  course but aced  making grown adults giggle like children.  take a break from the mundane and check out these stunners from overseas.alfa romeo giulia quadrifoglio (italy)image credit: stellantis.the giulia qv is what happens when italians look at a bmw m3 and say,  cute, but we can do better.  with 505 horsepower from a ferrari-derived twin-turbo v6, this thing will hit 60 mph in 3.8 seconds while making sounds that would make a gregorian choir weep with joy.the carbon fiber hood has functional vents that actually do something (unlike your neighbor s honda civic), and the aerodynamics were developed in a wind tunnel, not a pizza oven. sure, it might spend more time at the mechanic than in your driveway  this is alfa romeo, after all   but when it s running, it s the most charismatic sport sedan on the planet. the infotainment might freeze occasionally, but your heart rate sure won t.fun fact: it holds the lap record for a production sedan at the n rburgring. take that, germany.lotus emira (uk)image credit: lotus cars.the emira is lotus s farewell letter to internal combustion, and they re going out swinging. at just 3,100 pounds, it makes a miata look like it s been hitting the buffet too hard. the toyota-sourced supercharged v6 produces 400 hp, which in something this light is like strapping a rocket to a paper airplane.this is a car that still uses actual cable steering   remember that? when you turned the wheel, and the wheels actually turned without a computer asking permission first? the suspension setup is so sophisticated that lotus engineers probably need therapy after designing it, with bilstein dampers and eibach springs that make every pothole a learning experience.at least it has a comfortable cabin that doesn t constantly fall apart. progress! (depending on who you ask.)alpine a110 (france)image credit: alpine.the french decided to prove that you don t need 700 hp to have fun, just good taste and a complete disregard for straight-line bragging rights. the a110 weighs barely 2,400 pounds, and its 252-hp turbo four is tuned for responses sharper than french cheese criticism.built on a bespoke aluminum platform (not some parts-bin special), it features double wishbone suspension all around and a mid-engine layout that makes physics your co-pilot. the steering is so precise, you could probably perform surgery with it. the trunk space, however, suggests alpine expects you to pack like you re going to space camp.it s proof that sometimes the french do know what they re doing, even if they refuse to admit it.aston martin vantage (uk)image credit: aston martin.the vantage takes mercedes  excellent 4.0-liter twin-turbo v8 and gives it a british accent and anger management issues. with 503 hp and 505 lb-ft of torque, it ll launch to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds while sounding like hercules clearing his throat before a storm.the chassis is 70% stiffer than the previous generation (which was already stiffer than most british upper lips), and the adaptive dampers have three settings: comfortable, firm, and  why did i eat lunch?  the interior features real leather from cows that were probably happier than mostaston martinaccountants.yes, it shares an engine with a mercedes-amg, but at least it doesn t look like it was designed by a committee of efficiency experts wearing sensible shoes.ferrari roma (italy)image credit: ferrari.ferrari looked at their own 488 and said,  what if we made this pretty and fast?  the roma s 3.9-liter twin-turbo v8 pumps out 612 hp, which is enough to make you question your life choices while simultaneously making the best ones.this isn t just a pretty face: the roma features ferrari s side slip control system, which basically lets the computer be your wingman when you inevitably bite off more than you can chew. the 8-speed dual-clutch transmission shifts faster than italian governments change, and the manettino dial lets you choose just how much you trust yourself.the interior ditches most physical buttons in favor of touch controls, because apparently even ferrari thinks we needed more ways to accidentally turn on the hazards while trying to adjust the air conditioning.maserati mc20 (italy)image credit: maserati.after years of rebadging chryslers and calling it a day, maserati finally remembered they used to make actual supercars. the mc20 s 3.0-liter twin-turbo v6   called  nettuno  because italians name engines like roman gods   produces 621 hp from just six cylinders. it s like they compressed a v8 s worth of violence into fewer pistons.the carbon fiber monocoque chassis weighs less than most people s student loan debt, and the butterfly doors open to reveal a cabin that s actually usable, unlike certain german supercars that require yoga certification to exit gracefully.zero to 60 happens in 2.9 seconds, which is quick enough to make you forget about all those years when maserati s idea of performance was a louder exhaust on a ghibli.jaguar f-type r (uk)image credit: jaguar.the f-type r is what happens when british engineers are given asupercharged v8and told to  make it interesting.  with 575 hp from a 5.0-liter supercharged unit, this thing sounds like it s trying to wake the dead   and succeeding.the all-wheel-drive system can send up to 50% of power to the front wheels, which is helpful when you realize that 502 lb-ft of torque through the rear wheels alone might actually rotate the earth in the opposite direction. the active exhaust system has a  quiet start  feature, presumably for neighbors who haven t committed any serious crimes.sure, it weighs more than a small building, but sometimes you need mass to contain that much british fury. plus, it looks better than anything german designers have penned since they discovered cad software.koenigsegg jesko (sweden)image credit: koenigsegg jesko.the jesko is what happens when swedish engineers get bored and decide to build something that makes physics professors cry. the 5.0-liter twin-turbo v8 produces up to 1,600 hp on racing fuel: that s more power than some small power plants generate.the 9-speed multi-clutch transmission (yes, nine) can skip gears like a stone across water, and the active aerodynamics generate enough downforce to drive upside down at 160 mph. the carbon fiber wheels weigh less than most people s smartphones, and the interior features a steering wheel that costs more than most people s cars.only 125 will be built, which means you re more likely to spot bigfoot than see one at your local car meet. but hey, at least sweden finally found something to do with all that nobel prize money.renault megane r.s. trophy (france)image credit: renault.while everyone else was building 700-hp monsters, renault quietly perfected the art of making 300 hp feel like 500. the trophy s 1.8-liter turbo four produces 300 hp and 310 lb-ft, which doesn t sound like much until you realize it weighs about as much as a well-fed golden retriever.the cup chassis features  hlins dampers and a torsen limited-slip differential that actually works, unlike certain german competitors who think electronic nannies are a substitute for proper mechanical grip. the recaro seats hug you tighter than your mother at the airport, and the steering is so direct you can feel individual pebbles through the wheel.it s proof that the french can build something other than incomprehensible art films and cheese that smells like feet.aston martin db12 (uk)image credit: aston martin.the db12 is aston s attempt to prove they can build something that s both beautiful and fast, rather than just beautiful and temperamental. the mercedes-amg-sourced 4.0-liter twin-turbo v8 has been massaged to produce 671 hp, because apparently 630 wasn t quite enough to make bmw owners nervous.the chassis features adaptive dampers with three settings:  comfortable enough for downton abbey,   sporty enough for the cotswolds,  and  track day, darling.  the interior features leather from cows that were read bedtime stories, and the infotainment system actually works, which is revolutionary for aston martin.it s still an aston, so expect it to depreciate faster than your faith in humanity, but at least it ll look gorgeous while doing it.lotus evija (uk)image credit: lotus.lotus  goal was to build something with a literal soul. the evija s four electric motors produce a combined 2,000 hp   that s more power than a formula 1 car, and approximately 1,950 hp more than the original lotus seven.the carbon fiber body is so aerodynamically sophisticated that it probably has its own phd in fluid dynamics. lotus claims that this car  eats  air thanks to its venturi tunnels in the back, essentially meaning the car is alive. the batteries can charge at 350kw, which means you can add 250 miles of range in about 12 minutes   just enough time to question whether you really need to travel at light speed, but not enough time to care.only 130 will be built, each one lighter than a traditional hypercar and faster than good sense should allow. it s proof that even when lotus goes electric, they still remember that  simplify, then add lightness  applies to everything except theprice tag.pagani huayra (italy)image credit: pagani.the huayra is what happens when someone gives a renaissance artist a carbon fiber budget and a mercedes-amg engine catalog. each car is essentially a rolling sculpture that happens to have 730 hp from a twin-turbo v12 that sounds like angels singing opera in italian.the active aerodynamics include flaps that move like butterfly wings, because regular aerodynamics are for peasants. the interior features so much carbon fiber and aluminum that it looks like a spacecraft designed by someone with exquisite taste and unlimited resources.horacio pagani builds about 40 cars per year, each one taking longer to complete than most college degrees. but when you re creating automotive art that can hit 238 mph, rushing seems rather vulgar.europe s performance spirit lives beyond germanyimage credit: aston martin.these dozen examples prove that european performance isn t a german monopoly   it s a continent-wide conspiracy to makedriving funagain. from italian passion projects to british engineering madness, french philosophical statements, and swedish experiments in applied physics, these cars represent everything that makes the european approach to performance special: they re not just fast, they re interesting.so the next time someone tells you german cars are the only serious performance option, remind them that variety is the spice of life: and these spices happen to come with very large horsepower numbers and very small production runs. your wallet might not thank you, but your soul definitely will.author:vuk jovanovic"

    "text": "donald trump is a one-in-a-million american president who has detonated long-recognized national standards. each week brings fresh hell: he s urged the u.s. military to launch war games in democratic cities to learn tobattle the  enemy from within, deployed ice agents tohurl chicago pedestrians to the groundandzip-tie sobbing children, and he s called for the arrest of critics such as illinois governor jb pritzker and chicago mayor brandon johnsonfor no discernible crimeother than dissent.trump s administration hasindicted new york attorney general letitia jameson alleged mortgage fraud after she successfullyconvicted him of 34 felonies; pounded late-night comedians who mock him; and yanked billions of contractually obligated dollars from  woke  (as opposed to sleeping or dead) universities and states money approved by congress, which was granted that funding power by the u.s. constitution. in addition, the stuck-in-adolescence, name-calling trump has so very unpresidentially lashed his foes as  scum,   losers,   satan,   phony,   dopey,   fucking negative,   vermin,  and  crazy  and lobbed taunts at women like  nasty,  horseface,   slob,   fat pig,  and  dog. in trump s latest stunt he sported a crown in a faked truth social video featuring himpiloting a fighter jet to drop tons of shit on throngs of no kings protesters. it was another appalling new low for an american president, but we were hardly shocked. and that s a big problem.this weekend s protests were inspiring that they inspired this grotesque reaction from trump could count as a measure of success. but there is still much work to be done. it remains to be seen if the teeming masses can dent the president s power or shake more people from the torpor of the daily news to propel them into a sustained new activism. it s here at the apex of our exultation that we should pause, take stock, and stay on our guard, because one of the biggest enemies of the sustained momentum the anti-trump movement needs, it turns out, is human nature.amid the now-daily onslaught of trumpian shock and awe, many of us now just hear, digest, and move on. there s a familiar feeling of exhaustion and paralysis in the face of the deluge; it s hard to imagine a substantial response to any one of trump s misdeeds when we know that more are on the way. trump really has to work hard to stun in the way he once did. many american brains seem to be powering down into a dazed lethargy, benumbed by a relentless onslaught of the outrageous that we cannot entirely shut out.the researchers who study human behavior are not startled by these reactions. they have warned for decades that our canny adaptability and survival instincts our species  special drive to keep on keeping on, persisting through drought, pestilence, famine, warfare, and holocaust, is celebrated. but those same instincts can betray us and threaten to lead us off a cliff. it s a very strange time to be living in,  yale professor of cognitive science and philosophy joshua knobe told me. he studies human behavior, but he s not one to hazard a prediction about where we may end up.  maybe these changes haven t been frequent long enough to have a major impact on what we increasingly consider normal,  he suggested, referring to trump s upheaval. it s unclear what will ultimately happen. but eight years ago, it was knobe sounding an alarm at the start of trump s first administration. in anew york timesop-ed, knobe cautioned readers of trump s ability to catch us up in a  normalization trap  as the president s relentlessly outrageous pronouncements and policies often parroted uncritically by the media begin to sound less and less shocking. theconsequences can be serious,  knobe and yale psychology student adam bear discovered intheir research, and warned in thetimes. as trump carried out actions and repeatedly spouted positions that  once would have been regarded as outlandish,  they became increasingly regarded as both more  typical  and  normal,  they wrote.  as a result, they will come to be seen as less worthy of outrage. humans tend to conflate their sense of what is typical with their sense of what is  ideal,  cautioned knobe and bear. people  might sometimes be able to separate out theaverage from the ideal, but they more often make use of a kind of reasoning that blends the two together into a single undifferentiated judgment of normality,  the researchers discovered.the situation is aided and abetted by another powerful aspect of human nature: our  positive optimistic bias,  which the late princeton psychologist and behavioral economist daniel kahneman characterized as the  most significant  of humans  cognitive biases, in his bookthinking, fast and slow. the hardwired human trait is another boon to survival it keeps us moving forward through adversity, and encourages us to take risks that could be beneficial. the other side of the coin, noted kahneman, is the way these instincts can blind us to lethal risks.kahneman once described the 2016 presidential campaign as  unbelievable,  as well as anastounding opportunity to study human judgment.without mentioning trump by name, the 2002 nobel prize winner in economics said in an interview at anew yorkerevent in manhattan a month before trump s first election:  i find it unbelievable, this phenomenon that is happening right now, when you have a 7-year-old running for president a very big 7-year-old, fortunereported.kahneman warned then that the human brain  and our impulses  haven t changed in the last century, presenting risks.  our intrinsic makeup hasn t improved, and we re still vulnerable,  he warned. individuals yield to social pressure,  kahneman added, citing a continuing human  appeal to strength; this idea that being big and strong is highly valued and masculine i might add.  he warned in his book that humans rely on their more primitive  system 1  brains  fast, intuitive, and emotional thinking  much more often than  system 2,  which is slower and more logical.while  normalization  of deviance may be the most powerful, and insidious, manner of steering a nation off his cliff, trump has also utilized more obvious and familiar strategies in his battles against thought. borrowing a familiar political playbook from our earlier ominous history, trump hasrelentlessly vilified an  out group as scapegoats for all the evils of the world while cultivating a separate supportive clique of  in-crowd  humans who imagine themselves both special and put-upon.he alsorepeatedly exploits fearwith lies, including made-up stories about pet-eating haitian immigrants, and a  burning  portland, oregon (with republicans using protest photos fromsouth america).  things are terrible here. we won t have a country left,  he has said in his campaigns. kahneman and research partner amos tversky found that people experience the emotional pain of a loss about twice as strongly as the pleasure of a gain. trump s repeated apocalyptic warnings, as well as dwelling on specific gruesome crimes, speak to the primitive brain far more effectively than facts revealing that crime is decreasing and the nation is safer, kahneman noted.trump also often delivers his warnings with a visceral appeal to our primitive minds by  displaying  in a manner similar to our ape ancestors, primatologist jane goodall noted in a2022 msnbc interview. goodall said trump exhibited  the same sort of behavior as a male chimpanzee will show when he s competing for dominance with another. they re upright, they swagger, they project themselves as really more large and aggressive than they may actually be in order tointimidate their rivals,  she said. (goodall, who died earlier this month, said in a posthumously released interview that she wanted torocket trump and elon musk and vladimir putin into outer space, for good.)the term  normalization of deviance  may seem hopelessly academic, but its origins are found in a shared cultural tragedy. the term was initially coined by columbia university sociology professor diane vaughan after repeatedlyignored warningsabout a flaw in the o rings of thechallengerspace shuttle resulted in its shocking explosion on live tv in 1986, in which all seven astronauts aboard lost their lives as a stunned america watched.the proximate cause of the disaster stemmed from nasa s critical employees turning their backs on their own safety standards in an insidious example of organizational groupthink, vaughan noted in her 1996 book,the challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture and deviance at nasa. that study has since been cited as a warning for the current political era.the horrific accident was not due to a surprise flaw or to bad actors, vaughan concluded, but instead to a creeping shift in the  culture  of nasa that ultimately shrugged off concerns about the problem with the o rings. the subsequent tragedy was the result of an  incremental  but growing  descent into poor judgment  that emerged from the  banality of organizational life,  vaughan noted in her book. if that sounds familiar, you re likely recalling philosopher hannah arendt s own citation ofanother  banality   of evil  to explain how seemingly decent humans were willing to do hitler s bidding.social  normalization of deviance means that people within an organization become so much accustomed to a deviant behavior that they don t consider it as deviant, despite the fact that they far exceed their own rules for elementary safety,  vaughan warned in a2008 interview. a  common pattern  of organizations that slip into  deviance  includes a  longincubation period filled with early warning signs that were either missed or misinterpreted or ignored,  she added.what can be done to protect ourselves from trump s tool box and our own human nature? is mere awareness of our tendency to become inured to the unusual and backslide into treating deviance as normal a strong enough beginning?here, knobe cautions against knee-jerk pessimism. while daily events may seem overwhelming or even enraging the future is constantly being forged. knobe emphasizes that humans have made tremendous strides in history, but often over decades trump s may simply be an incendiary presidential administration that s ultimately a feeble blip in time. he points to revolutionary changes in our perspectives on issues like racism, sexual harassment and slavery. while these sensibilities are under constant attack, they ve proven to be enduring values, not easily erased. if you lived in 1850 and saw someone with a slave, you might think,  how awful,  but there s little you could have changed about it, and it was widely viewed as acceptable,  knobe said.  now, we would be horrified. he warns that emphasizing polarization and the negativity of the current political landscape could have a backlash, just as trump s repeated evocation of a pending apocalypse could actually bring about the violence about which he warns, given the way the human mind works. knobe points out research that college campaigns to reduce student drinking by emphasizing the problemmay have triggered an increase in drinking. better, he said, to emphasize the number of students not drinking or, in politics, what large numbers of republicans have traditionally believed in the past to make them appear more recognizable and less oppositional.and trump s own antisocial tendencies can still shock us out of our torpor and short-circuit the administration s desire to normalize all of its aberrance. robert reich, former u.s. labor secretary under president bill clinton, insisted in a talk on october 9 that trump s deployment of federalized national guard troops into democratic cities, amid a fantasy of imploding violence, has finally crossed a line for americans, thesan francisco chroniclereported. something dramatic has happened,  reich said onstage at the university of california-berkeley after a showing ofthe lastclass, a documentary about his career in public service and as a university professor.  something has come out into the open that [makes] a lot of people who are on the edge, a lot of independents, a lot of people who really don t know their politics   a little bit afraid.  and they re saying,  what, the texas national guard is coming into chicago over the objections of the mayor and the governor of illinois, and they are coming in there and they are doing what? and the president is saying what?  reich argued that the optics of trump s policies are so  awful  that they ll  activate  americans, the newspaper noted. they  enable people to see something that is not just political,  he said.  it s not right versus left, it is not democrats versus republicans,  reich added.  it s fundamental: democracy versus fascism. mary papenfussmary papenfuss has worked as a reporter and editor at thenew york daily news, huffpost andthe independent, and was the co-author ofamerican huckster, the story of the fifa scandal.read more:politics,donald trump,authoritarianism,fascism,psychology,social psychology"

another algorithmically-curated, endless scroll of videos, sora is different from its predecessors in that everything in its feed is fake created entirely using artificial intelligence (ai).within days of its launch, the internet was filled with reels of famous (sometimes long-deceased) people in impossible situations winning a nobel prize, stealing gpus from target or being escorted off a plane for trying to smuggle a baby kangaroo. while many of these videos were obviously fake, others seemed disconcertingly real.also read|race against deepfake ads: will ai regulation catch up?ai has

while i have no doubt that the big ai labs will immediately implement these new requirements, there are already dozens of alternatives that provide similar functionality but operate under far fewer constraints. all that a law like this would do is encourage those who use these tools for ill intent to move their operations to the margins.our focus should not be on identifying what is false, but instead on making it easy to identify what is real. we need to find a way to ensure that anyone who wants to do so can easily identify whether an image or piece of video footage has been captured

    "text": "clifford winstonoctober 22nd, 2025despite his apparent disqualifications for the presidency, trump s symbolism is what appeals to his supporters0 comments| 8 sharesestimated reading time: 8 minutesclifford winstonoctober 22nd, 2025despite his apparent disqualifications for the presidency, trump s symbolism is what appeals to his supporters0 comments| 8 sharesestimated reading time: 8 minutes8sharesalthough he was impeached by the us house, found liable in civil cases for defamation and sexual abuse, and implemented potentially disastrous economic policies, donald trump was elected to the presidency twice and still has the support of many americans.clifford winstonwrites that trump s strongest supporters have been able to set aside his disqualifications and character flaws because they see him as a symbol for their own desires.president donald trumprecently suggestedthat what he had called  trump derangement syndrome  should be recognized as a disease. trump focused on the symptoms of the alleged disease: strong opposition to his behavior and policies. but these are entirely reasonable points of view and indicate that  trump derangement syndrome  is not a disease.trump delusion syndrometo use trump s framing,  trumpdelusionsyndrome  could similarly be considered to be a disease. its symptoms have resulted in a notable share of the public deluding themselves that, despite trump s glaring personal flaws and his counterproductive policy positions, he is qualified to be president. indeed,  trump delusion syndrome  is the most plausible explanation of how trump was twice elected. fortunately, this syndrome appears to be treatable in some sufferers by greater exposure to reality as trump s second term unfolds, because more thanhalf of poll respondentsnow believe trump lacks the qualifications to be president.trump has never attempted to hide his personal flaws. their potential harm to the nation is reflected in his destructive behavior, support of counterproductive policies, and contempt for constructive advice. first, trump isirrational and delusional, meaning that he is incapable of being guided by an analytical framework and empirical evidence to understand the justification for a policy. thus, he makes delusional assertions about policy issues; for example, saying climate change is ahoaxand that tariffs increase jobs whileforeign countries, not us consumers, bear their cost. a district judge who trump appointed wrote that his determination as to the reason to deploy troops in portland was  untethered to the facts. second, trump is anarcissist, as evidenced by publicly proclaiming that he is on amission from godand that heruns both the country and the world. he intimidates experts who might otherwise provide valuable policy guidance; for example, medical experts refused to convince him to retract his dangerously falseclaimthat 99 percent of covid-19 cases are harmless. and because trump is insecure, he appointssycophantsto his administration to ensure agreement.finally, trump is anihilist, who doesn t believe in using government policy or market forces to improve people s lives. instead, he believes in his gut instinct about what is right for the us and expects others to do the same. his recently enactedmegalawcould have improved government efficiency both by withdrawing economic regulations from industries where market forces could produce more efficient outcomes than regulatory interventions and by reforming certain policies to improve their efficiency. however, the law makes no attempt to accomplish either objective. instead, it enables trump to have more influence over people s lives where he sees fit to intervene.trump s disqualificationstrump s irrationality, delusions, narcissism, and nihilism drive his behavior that is disqualifying for the presidency in three ways. first, from a constitutional perspective, trump s fomenting of an insurrection after being fairly voted out of officeviolates section 3 of the 14th amendment, which bars individuals who have  engaged in insurrection or rebellion  against the us from holding office. in addition, hisextortionof president volodymyr zelensky to receive funds that had been committed to ukraine by congress violated the separation of powers as codified in the constitution. both of those actions led to trump s impeachment by the house of representatives withsupport for conviction by senators from both parties, indicating that a notable share of members of congress believed that trump s behavior was disqualifying for the presidency.second, trump s behavior has fallen far below historical standards by us presidents on several occasions. to wit, no us presidents have been convicted of a felony, let alone34 felonies, before trump and have suffered defeats in civil cases forsexual abuseanddefamation. no modern us president has so blatantly used the office for financial gain, such asprofitingfrom foreign and domestic visitors and government employees patronizing his hotel near the white house and accumulating wealth from acryptocurrency empire. and no us president has so frequently attempted to undermine democratic norms by viciously attacking the judiciary, media, and law enforcement. donald trump  bygage skidmore,cc by-sa 4.0finally, from an economic perspective, trump has threatened the nation s material quality of life by initiating policies that greatly reduce theefficiency of marketsand discourageinnovation. indeed,the 2025 nobel prize in economicsdrew attention to trump s policies that are hostile towards immigration and innovation by awarding the prize to three immigrants to the us who advanced our understanding of innovation-driven growth. in sum, from a constitutional, historical, and economic perspective, it is extremely difficult to understand how a rational public could believe that trump was qualified to hold the presidency.explaining trump s electoral victoriesthe economic, political, psychological, and sociological explanations that have been proffered to explain trump s election victories are unpersuasive because they fail to come to terms with trump s lack of qualifications. first, they allege trump s character and policy weaknesses are strengths. his economic nationalism of opposing free trade and immigration is a viewed as a strength despite its widespreadoppositionby economists and traditional republicans and the lack of evidence of benefits to his supporters.trump s bombast and pugnaciousness also are claimed to be strengths by showing he is a strong leader and a fighter. but trump was weak in leading the public to safely avoid covid-19, failed to stand up to putin, and earned the monikertaco trump always chickens out for his erratic implementation of tariffs. trump is not a fighter but a bully against people and institutions with fewer resources than the federal government.second, explanations of trump s victories assert that demographic and socioeconomic changes in america have worked to trump s advantage. blue collar workers have become anti-establishment; black and hispanic americansare more disposed to trumpwith him gaining a majority of hispanic male voters; and less affluent white men who focus on tribal identity, a loss of status, and being left behind in favor of immigrants have flocked to trump. but it is puzzling how trump could be perceived as a loyal ally because his policies benefit affluent people and corporations and his lack of support for medicaid, improved healthcare, and vaccines leaves these groups disproportionately vulnerable to illnesses that could kill them financially and physically.finally, explanations rationalize that trump s victories justify ignoring his flawed character. so, not to worry about trump s conviction on 34 felony counts and losing a sexual assault civil case. people compartmentalize trump s inherited wealth, lies, and emotional problems because to them he is more of a symbol than a person.trump becomes what his supporters want him to bein the eyes of his supporters, trump became their own chauncey gardiner of our time, from the 1979 satirical filmbeing there, a man whose entire knowledge, other than gardening, is derived entirely from television. in the film, when potential replacements for the president were being considered, it was unanimously agreed that the public s willingness to simultaneouslymisinterpretandprojectchauncey into something he wasn t but was what they wanted him to be made him the ideal successor.to understand the basis for  trump delusion syndrome,  just substitute trump for chauncy and consider how trump s supporters project their desires onto what they want him to be. for example, white evangelicals, who ignore trump s divorces, lack of regular church attendance, and so on, believe that it waspart of god s planfor trump to be elected president. indeed, there does not appear to be anything trump can do to lose his strongest supporters. on the other hand, it will not be easy for another republican to capture trump s support after he leaves office.with time and a greater understanding by more of the public of trump s character and the effects of his policies, we can hope that  trump delusion syndrome  and his maga movement will eventually disappear and be remembered only as an unfortunate chapter in american presidential history.subscribe tolse usapp s email newsletterto receive a weekly article roundup.please read our comments policy before commenting.note: this article gives the views of the author, and not the position of usapp   american politics and policy, nor the london school of economics.about the authorclifford winstonclifford winston is a senior fellow in the brookings institution s economic studies program. he is an applied microeconomist who specializes in the analysis of industrial organization, regulation, and transportation. he is the author of market corrections not government interventions: a path to improve the us economy (https://www.amazon.com/market-corrections-not-government-interventions/dp/3031928148).posted in:democracy and culture | trump's second term | uncategorizedleave a replycancel replyyour email address will not be published.required fields are marked*comment*name*email*website related poststrump's second termtrump s big beautiful bill is exposing the identity crisis within the republican partyjune 27th, 2025trump's second termtrump s re-election is a new chapter in britain s fluctuating relationship with americafebruary 25th, 2025democracy and culturean important source of declassified materials for scholars of american diplomacy is now under threatmay 7th, 2025democracy and culturetrump s defiant address to congress continued his combative politics of grievancemarch 5th, 2025visit our sister blog: british politics and policy at lselatest lse events podcastshow progress ends: technology, innovation, and the fate of nationsoctober 21, 2025on liberalism: in defence of freedomoctober 17, 2025the ceo: the rise and fall of britain's captains of industryoctober 16, 2025us-iran relations under trump 2.0: prospects and challengesoctober 15, 2025permission to be queer: the case for libertyoctober 14, 2025why we're getting pooreroctober 13, 2025not just lines on a map: borders in a changing worldoctober 9, 2025the promise and peril of trump's america firstoctober 8, 2025how to save the internetoctober 8, 2025the crime of war: from the nuremberg trial to ukraineoctober 7, 2025"

    "text": "in 2010, human rights activist liu xiaobo became the first chinese dissident ever towinthe nobel peace prize. jailed at the time of his award, he delivered his speech in absentia.  i have no enemies and no hatred,  his statement read, reiterating a famous line from hisjune second hunger strike declarationon the eve of thetiananmen square massacrein 1989. liu would die in jail seven years later, at the age of 61, a symbol of resistance to chinese authoritarianism and of the fight for free expression.though liu is hardly a household name in america, he is a pivotal figure for understanding modern china, argues pulitzer prize-winning journalist ian johnson, who has covered china for 35 years.writing for thenew york review of books, johnson revieweda comprehensive biography of liu that had been largely ignored by the mainstream press. hisreviewofi have no enemies, by perry link and wu dazhi (columbia university press 2024), won thewashington monthly s2025 kukula award for excellence in nonfiction book reviewingfor large publications. in this episode of thewashington monthly s podcast, johnson discusses the significance of liu s life and what americans misunderstand about china.this transcript has been edited for length and clarity. the full interview is available onspotify,youtubeand itunes.***anne kim:welcome, ian, and congratulations!you chose to review a 550-page biography that you noted had been  all but shunned by the mainstream media with substantive reviews only appearing in two publications, thelos angeles review of booksand thechina books review. and there was a one paragraph review inforeign affairs.  why did you choose this book and what did you see as its significance?ian johnson:well, i thought the topic itself was in some ways a slam dunk because the topic of the biography, liu xiaobo, is the only chinese nobel peace prize laureate, excluding the dalai lama. so in that sense, he s an important historical figure. he died in custody in prison, making him the first nobel peace prize laureate to die since a german journalist died during the nazi era.the biographers include perry link, who s probably one of the most distinguished and important scholars of chinese literature and dissent over the past century, as well as a chinese colleague who went by a pseudonym but is also a well-known person. so i thought the combination of subject and authors just made this a really important book, an inherently important book.it s the kind of book that, whether it s good or bad, should be reviewed. there haven t been really very many biographies of liu xiaobo, and no major comprehensive biographies.anne kim:one of the interesting things about your review is that you spend the first two thirds actually talking about the details of liu s life. and there are a lot of things that i didn t know and probably a lot of americans didn t about his life. i m wondering if that was part of the goal of your review simply to educate americans about this really remarkable figure who is not as well-known as he should be in america.ian johnson:absolutely. i think that one of the tragedies of the chinese dissident movement is that on the one hand, some people do take it very seriously, but i think that it s often been kind of overshadowed or ignored in our view of china.for the past 40 years, the story has been of china becoming an economic juggernaut. when i was in china starting out as a correspondent in the 1990s, that was the story. later, i joined thewall street journalas a macroeconomics reporter and covered china s accession to the wto. and it was all about  china s rising, china s rising, and they re going to eat our lunch.  people would go to china like tom friedman every once in a while and say,  my goodness, a shanghai taxi driver told me they re going to eat our lunch.  i m joking, but i think that s been the dominant story.now it s china, the big scary superpower that s got hypersonic missiles and is threatening taiwan and secretly backing putin in ukraine.those are all perfectly valid and important stories. but there is also a missed story, which is the universality of chinese thought and that there are chinese people, just like everywhere in the world, who want to be able to express themselves, who want to participate in their government.it irked me that people like liu xiaobo were not better known in the west, whereas a generation or two ago, their equivalents in the soviet union were very well known and were taken much more seriously.anne kim:well, i m wondering if americans are going to be more interested now in the techniques of dissidence, if nothing else, given everything that s happening in america today.ian johnson:i think that one of the inspiring things about china and chinese people like liu xiaobo is how they pushed for ideals even in the darkest of hours that in the hardest of times, people like this still stood up and still wanted to be counted. i think that s inspiring no matter where you come from on the political spectrum and no matter what era or what culture you come from.anne kim:another interesting aspect about your review is the fact that you talk about how much liu knew a lot about america, even though americans don t know much about him. he studied at columbia university and at the university of hawaii. he was an advocate of the westernization of china.you also talk about misperceptions of chinese history in american eyes. talk a little bit about how liu s life explains the arc of chinese history in 20th century through today and why he is the right prism for understanding china.ian johnson:liu was born about a decade after the founding of the people s republic of china in 1949. he grew up in a communist party ecosystem when china was closed off to the outside world. his father was an academic who worked for a state-run university. and they suffered a little bit in the mao era, but he grew up with the offspring of generals and so forth. after mao died in the late 1970s and china embarked on what s known as the  reform era,  when they turned their back on planned economics and so on, liu really embraced that period and became probably china s best known public intellectual. he was a bit na ve, and his life story follows this arc of how chinese intellectuals dealt with the outside world over the past half century.he was, as you said, an advocate of full-scale westernization of china. at times he said there s nothing of value in chinese culture, and he was a bit of an iconoclast. he liked to exaggerate. but i think he really embraced the idea that we need to throw ourselves open to the outside world. we have to learn from the west and so on.but the chinese system proved to be more durable than perhaps he had hoped, especially after the tiananmen massacre when the party put a stake in the ground and said,  no way are we going to have political reform like that. we re not going to have a gorbachev-style revolution with the communist party folding.  then he had to think of other ways to challenge the party. he was really influenced by a very famous chinese novelist, wang xiaobo, who talked about the silent majority of people in china who are victims of the system. people who may be farmers, who may be miners, who don t have workers  rights, who don t have freedom of speech, who may be of a different sexual orientation.liu xiaobo embraced the idea of trying to improve things at the local level for these people. so instead of big grandiose statements about freedom of expression and democracy, he began to work for the rights of these people on a smaller level. and that became his modus operandi from the late 1990s until his imprisonment after the beijing olympics in 2008. i think that s a really interesting trajectory.anne kim:how did he actually do this grassroots work? what were the mechanisms he used to spread his message, and how did that bubble up into a nationwide movement?ian johnson:this was not just liu but a group of public intellectuals at the time who were drawing on ideas from eastern and central europe. but the way they did it in the late 1990s was to make use of the internet. now we know that the internet can be easily controlled and manipulated and can create these echo chambers where people are not being informed.but at that time in the late 1990s, there was a lot of optimism about the internet and it wasn t so tightly censored in china. so, say, somebody in a local town would find a factory that was egregiously polluting the local water supply, just turning it black with pollution, killing all the fish, destroying irrigation network and causing crops to fail. they would take videos and post it on blogs or on social media, and this would create pressure on the government to change things.this was a tactic that these activists used time and again, and these cases became celebrated national cases as a way of pushing the government for some sort of change. that was liu s contribution for about a decade.anne kim:but then there was his imprisonment, which was also a catalyst.ian johnson:so his arc does unfortunately does continue on into the 2010s, by which time the government is no longer so open.there was a golden age for chinese civil society from the mid 1990s until about 2010. but this was a time when there was interesting independent chinese journalism, there were bloggers, there were social media activists, there was a great independent movement for documentary films. about 200 independent documentary films are made at this time, sometimes detailing and dissecting issues such as pollution in a local area or problems with policies toward ethnic minorities in china. this all was done by people making use of digital technologies like digital cameras and pdfs in order to write books or to resurrect books that had been banned in the past. they could reprint them as a pdf and email them to get around censorship.so there was this great period, but it came to an end when the party felt that the pendulum had gone too far, and they saw what had happened in the soviet union. and xi jinping epitomizes that trend. he has spoken very openly about the fall of the soviet union being a great catastrophe and that it was basically because it was undermined by too much civil society. so the party collectively decided in the late 2000s to change this.so in 2008 this is before xi jinping took power, but as part of that overall trend liu xiaobo was detained and then eventually sentenced.anne kim:after he passed away in 2017, what s happened to the chinese dissident movement since then?ian johnson:well, it s a dark period for people inside china who are pushing for political change. it s not as bad as in the mao era, let s say, but it s still a time when these channels that i talked about during that golden era somewhat independent journalism, the internet have all been closed down systematically by the government, which has made a full court press to rein these in.and yet there are still people working and trying. there are still people making movies and editing books and publishing underground journals. it s just that they don t have a public platform anymore. these independent documentary films that i mentioned before there used to be independent film festivals, and people would go watch these films. now it s impossible.i spend a lot of my effort actually in running a nonprofit, a 501(c)(3) that i put together called the china unofficial archives, which is a platform for this kind of independent thought in china. we have over a thousand items, including films, books, and magazines that we re trying to preserve from vanishing. we digitize movies and magazines and put it up there for free, no paywall or registration required. we have a newsletter, and about a third of our readers come from inside china, which is heartening.anne kim:that s a really cool project. i do want to go back to this question of american perceptions of china, because so few people know about the fact of the existence of chinese dissidents and the arc of the life of someone like liu. you wrote in your review that  many people view china as deserving little more than opprobrium,  and that  many political leaders and commentators treat china as a country to be contained, but not engaged. what do you mean by  engagement ?ian johnson:this word has become almost taboo in the united states. it s been viewed as some sort of appeasement policy that failed in the 2000s or 2010s.but i think engagement is important on several levels.it s been the policy of various organizations, including at times the us government, to see china in three dimensions: as a systemic rival to the united states, which it is in many ways; as an economic competitor, which it definitely is; but also as a potential partner for cooperation in certain areas, such as terrorism or drugs or the climate.regardless of how you view china, you have to engage with the country.it s a country that i think demands our attention. we can t just wish it away and hope that putting up trade sanctions and tariffs will somehow contain it. it s much more sophisticated than, say, the soviet union was half a century ago. it s not something that you can simply call an  evil empire  and use military means to isolate. china is a really successful economic player, and it s going to be dominating major technologies through the 21st century.we have to understand it better. and that requires encouraging young people to study chinese. it s very depressing to see how few people now are studying chinese.and i think that chinese should be something that people should want to study, not just for some realpolitik point of view, but because it s a really important and interesting country that offers solutions to problems that we all grapple with.the way that they are rolling out renewable energy, for example, is interesting and impressive. and it s not just some  hitler built the autobahn  explanation of an authoritarian state doing whatever it wants. there s more to it. there s a dynamism in china that s very real and still has to be understood and experienced.anne kim:and china did just make this remarkable announcement at the united nations about making a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.ian johnson:yes, it was quite a contrast. trump was basically saying it s all hokum and that if you follow green policies, you re entirely wrong.china, meanwhile, is charging down the path of renewables. admittedly, they re still the world s largest polluter and emitter of greenhouse gases, so there s a bit of conundrum there, but they are going to potentially own these technologies, especially because they re subsidizing them.china is brutal and harsh, but the people running the country are not deluded. they understand what s happening. they ll still build coal-fired power plants because they need the energy, they want to keep producing, and they can t afford to have unemployment. but they know where the future is and they want to own the future.i think in that sense, it s another example of how china embraces the future, whereas in the united states, you get the feeling that the future is just a big, horrible, scary thing that we ve got to somehow avoid one way or another, whether it s sticking our head in the sand or what.but in china, there s this idea that they re going to own the 21st century. i think america had that last century, but it doesn t feel like the united states has that mojo anymore.anne kim:well, thank you so much for sharing your insights with us and for your review of a remarkable figure in history. really appreciate the chance to talk with you.relatedanne kimanne kim is a senior editor at washington monthly and the author of poverty for profit: how corporations get rich off america s poor (new press, 2024). anne

    "text": "prince harry, meghan join call for ban on development of ai 'superintelligence'prince harry and meghan have joined a diverse group, including steve bannon and glenn beck, to call for a ban on ai \"superintelligence\" that threatens humanitybymatt o'brien ap technology writeroctober 21, 2025, 8:47 pmprince harry and his wife meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical christian leaders and american conservative commentators steve bannon and glenn beck to call for a ban on ai  superintelligence  that threatens humanity.the letter, released wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like google, openai and meta platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.the 30-word statement says: we call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in. in a preamble, the letter notes that ai tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading ai companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. this has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction. prince harry added in a personal note that \"the future of ai should serve humanity, not replace it. i believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. there is no second chance. signing alongside the duke of sussex was his wife meghan, the duchess of sussex. this is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, stuart russell, an ai pioneer and computer science professor at the university of california, berkeley. \"it s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. is that too much to ask? also signing were ai pioneers yoshua bengio and geoffrey hinton, co-winners of the turing award, computer science's top prize. hinton also won a nobel prize in physics last year. both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.but the list also has some surprises, including bannon and beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit future of life institute to appeal to president donald trump's make america great again movement even as trump's white house staff has sought to reduce limits to ai development in the u.s.also on the list are apple co-founder steve wozniak; british billionaire richard branson; the former chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff mike mullen, who served under republican and democratic administrations; and democratic foreignpolicy expert susan rice, who was national security adviser to president barack obama.government shutdown updates: usda resumes some farm aid but bigger bailout uncertainoct 22, 2:29 pmisrael-gaza live updates: vance arrives at netanyahu's officeoct 22, 3:18 pm16 dead after 'devastating' blast at tennessee explosives plant, sheriff saysoct 11, 8:30 pmformerirish president mary robinsonand several british and european parliamentarians signed, as did actors stephen fry and joseph gordon-levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwiseembraced ai in musiccreation. yeah, we want specific ai tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote gordon-levitt, whose wife tasha mccauley served on openai's board of directors before the upheaval that led to ceo sam altman's temporary ouster in 2023.  but does ai also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? most people don t want that. the letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the ai research community about the likelihood of superhuman ai, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be. in the past, it s mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,  said max tegmark, president of the future of life institute and a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology.  i feel what we re really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream. confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or agi, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an ai bubble. openai was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and ai scientists when its researcher claimed chatgpt had figured out unsolved math problems   when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online. there s a ton of stuff that s overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn t change the fact that   zooming out   ai has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,  tegmark said.tegmark's group was also behind a march 2023 letter   still in the dawn of a commercial ai boom   that called on tech giants to pause the development of more powerful ai models temporarily. none of the major ai companies heeded that call. and the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, elon musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own ai startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.asked if he reached out to musk again this time, tegmark said he wrote to the ceos of all major ai developers in the u.s. but didn't expect them to sign. i really empathize for them, frankly, because they re so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,  tegmark said.  i think that s why it s so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the u.s. government just steps in. sponsored content by taboolagovernment shutdown updates: usda resumes some farm aid but bigger bailout uncertainoct 22, 2:29 pm16 dead after 'devastating' blast at tennessee explosives plant, sheriff saysoct 11, 8:30 pmisrael-gaza live updates: vance arrives at netanyahu's officeoct 22, 3:18 pmamerican chess grandmaster daniel naroditsky dies at 29oct 21, 12:02 amabc news live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

signer of the declaration of independence, benjamin rush (1825) ; and emperor alexander i of russia (1813).duringworld war ii, nazi propagandaportrayed jews as major spreaders of the disease as a way of garnering public support for imprisoning them in ghettos. in november 1940, the nazis walled more than 400,000 jewish people inside a 3.4-square-kilometre ghetto in warsaw, poland. the overcrowded conditions, lack ofsewage maintenance,and inadequate food and hospital resources meant that typhus rapidly infected about 100,000 people and caused 25,000 deaths.however, jewish people confined inside a nazi ghetto during the second world war were able to curb a massive typhus outbreak by introducing similar infection control measures. by october 1941, just before the following winter, new typhus infections suddenly ground to a halt. this was unexpected, because typhus normally accelerated at the start of winter, and ghettos in other places like ukraine were still being ravaged by the disease.  many thought it was a miracle,  saidlewi stoneat rmit university in australia.to find out how the warsaw ghetto stamped out typhus, stone and his colleagues examined historical documents from libraries around the world, including those kept by doctors who lived in the warsaw ghetto. they discovered that doctors imprisoned there including eminent microbiologist and nobel prize nomineeludwik hirszfeldwho helped discover different blood types led community efforts to stop the disease from spreading.hundreds of lectures were held in ghettos wherever people were forced to gather to educate the public about the importance of personal hygiene, social distancing, and self-isolating when sick. a secret university was also set up to train medical students in infection control, and community leaders helped to organize elaborate sanitation programs and soup kitchens. mathematical modelling by stone and his colleagues suggests that these measures prevented more than 100,000 typhus infections in the ghetto and tens of thousands of deaths.tragically, almost all the ghetto residents were later sent to die in extermination camps, which the nazis tried to justify as a means to prevent future typhus outbreaks. most notable victims wereann frankand her older sister,margotat bergen-belson.https://www.newscientist.com/article/2249578sherri boomershine is a woman of faith who loves all things foreign whether it s food, culture, or language. a former french teacher and flight attendant, her passion is traveling to the settings of her books, sampling the food, and visiting the sites. she visited a netherlands concentration camp fora song for her enemies, and paris art museums forwhat hides beyond the walls. sherri lives with her husband mike, her high school sweetheart, whom she married fifty-five years later. as an author and editor, she hopes her books will entertain and challenge readers to live large and connect with their savior. join, chat, and share with her on social media.newsletterfacebooktwitterinstagramwebsiteif the nazis stole your house, wouldn t you be justified in stealing it back?tamar kaplan is a budding soprano with the harlaam opera company. her future looks bright, despite the presence of the german soldiers guarding haarlem. but when nazi soldiers close down the opera company, families start disappearing in the middle of the night, and jews are stripped of their freedoms, tamar realizes her brother seth was right about her naivet . she joins the resistance, her blond hair and light features making it easy for her come and go under the watchful eyes of the german guards. tamar becomes dr. daniel feldman s assistant, as they visit families hiding out in forests and hovels, tending to their health needs. but when she returns home to find her parents gone and the family store looted, she and daniel must go into hiding. as they cling to the walls of an alley, tamar recognizes a familiar face that of neelie visser, the neighbor, who beckons to them to follow her. can she trust this gentile woman who talks about god as if he s standing next to her? https://bit.ly/40yucjvposted bysherri stewartat12:30 amemail thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterestlocation:chicago, il, usa"

  he said in an interview. it s been quite surprising to me that there has been less outright discussion of  do we want these things? do we want human-replacing ai systems?   he said.  it s kind of taken as: well, this is where it s going, so buckle up, and we ll just have to deal with the consequences. but i don t think that s how it actually is. we have many choices as to how we develop technologies, including this one. the statement isn t aimed at any one organization or government in particular. aguirre said he hopes to force a conversation that includes not only major ai companies, but also politicians in the united states, china and elsewhere. he said the trump administration spro-industry viewson ai need balance. this is not what the public wants. they don t want to be in a race for this,  he said. he said there might eventually need to be an international treaty on advanced ai, as there is for other potentially dangerous technologies.the white house didn t immediately respond to a request for comment on the statement tuesday, ahead of its official release.americansare almost evenly splitover the potential impact of ai, according to an nbc news decision desk poll powered by surveymonkey this year. while 44% of u.s. adults surveyed said they thought ai would make their and their families  lives better, 42% said they thought it would make their futures worse.top tech executives, who have offered predictions about superintelligence and signaled that they are working toward it as a goal, didn t sign the statement. meta ceo mark zuckerberg said in july that superintelligence was  now in sight.  musk posted on x in february that the advent of digital superintelligence  is happening in real-time  and has earlier warned about  robots going down the street killing people,  though now tesla, where musk is ceo, is working todevelop humanoid robots. openai ceo sam altman said last month thathe d be surprisedif superintelligence didn t arrive by 2030 and wrote in ajanuary blog postthat his company was turning its attention there.several tech companies didn t immediately respond to requests for comment on the statement.last week, thefuture of life institute told nbc newsthat openai had issued subpoenas to it and its president as a form of retaliation for calling for ai oversight. openai chief strategy officer jason kwon wrote on oct. 11 that the subpoena was a result of openai s suspicions around the funding sources of several nonprofit groups that had been critical of its restructuring.other signers of the statement include apple co-founder steve wozniak, virgin group co-founder richard branson, conservative talk show host glenn beck, former u.s. national security adviser susan rice, nobel-winning physicist john mather, turing award winner and ai researcher yoshua bengio and the rev. paolo benanti, a vatican ai adviser. several ai researchers based in china also signed the statement.aguirre said the goal was to have a broad set of signers from across society. we want this to be social permission for people to talk about it, but also we want to very much represent that this is not a niche issue of some nerds in silicon valley, who are often the only people at the table. this is an issue for all of humanity,  he said.david ingramdavid ingram is a tech reporter for nbc news."

    "text": "illustration by tag hartman-simkins / futurism. source: patrick t. fallon / afp; michael m. santiago; thomas banneyer/picture alliance via getty imageshundreds of public figures   including multiple ai  godfathers  and a staggeringly idiosyncratic array of religious, media, and tech figures   just signed a letter calling for a  prohibition  on the race to build ai superintelligence.simply titled the  statement on superintelligence,  theletter, which was put forward by the future of life institute (fli), is extremely concise: it calls for a  prohibition on the development of superintelligence,  which it says should not be  lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably  as well as with  strong public buy-in. the letter citesrecent pollingfrom fli, which was cofounded by the massachusetts institute of technology professor max tegmark, showing that only five percent of americans are in favor of the rapid and unregulated development of advanced ai tools, while more than 73 percent support  robust  regulatory action on ai. around 64 percent, meanwhile, said they felt that until superintelligence   or an ai model that surpasses human-level intelligence   could be proven to be safe or controllable, it shouldn t be built.signatories include prominent tech and business figures like apple cofounder steve wozniak and virgin founder richard branson; influential right-wing media voices like  war room  host steve bannon and talk radio host glenn beck, as well as left-leaning entertainers like joseph gordon-levitt; prince harry and meghan, duke and duchess of sussex; mike mullen, the retired us navy admiral who served as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under former presidents george w. bush and barack obama; friar paolo benanti, who serves as thepope s ai advisor; and a large consortium of ai experts and scientists including turing award winneryoshua bengioand nobel prize laureategeoffrey hinton, two consequential ai researchers who each hold the title  godfather of ai.  frontier ai systems could surpass most individuals across most cognitive tasks within just a few years,  bengio, a professor at the university of montreal, said in a press release.  these advances could unlock solutions to major global challenges, but they also carry significant risks.  to safely advance toward superintelligence, we must scientifically determine how to design ai systems that are fundamentally incapable of harming people, whether through misalignment or malicious use,  he added.  we also need to make sure the public has a much stronger say in decisions that will shape our collective future. crucially, the letter takes the position that superintelligence   a lofty, scifi-esque vision for ai s future   is an achievable technical goal, a position that some experts are skeptical of (or at least,believe to be a long way off.)it s also worth pointing out that the letter doesn t clarify the reality that ai doesn t have to reach superintelligence to cause chaos: as it stands, generative ai tools like chatbots and image and video-creation tools   primitive technologies when compared against imagined future superintelligent ai systems   areupending education, transforming the web into an increasinglymisinformation-prone and unreal environment, expediting the creation and dissemination ofnonconsensualandillegal pornography, and sending users of all ages spinning into mental health crises and reality breaks that have resulted in outcomes likedivorce,homelessness,jail, involuntary commitments,self-harm, and death.it s also interesting whodidn tsign the letter. notable missing names include openai ceo sam altman, deepmind cofounder and microsoft ai ceo mustafa suleyman, anthropic ceo dario amodei, white house ai and crypto czar david sacks, and xai founder elon musk, the latter of whom signed apreviousfli letterfrom 2023 calling for a pause on the development of ai models more advanced than openai s gpt-4. (that letter, of course, pretty much did nothing: gpt-5 was released this past summer.) altman, too, has signed similar letters calling for awareness about large-scale future ai risks, making silence at this juncture striking.given that this is one of multiple please-stop-advanced-ai-development-until-we-regulate letters to crop up since the release of chatgpt in late 2022, whether this one will prove to have any bite is an open question.still, the latest fli letter does highlight the breadth of ideologies united on the belief that ai should be regulated, and that how we build ai, and by whom, should be a democratic process. in other words, the public should have a say in what humanity s technological future looks like   and that shaping ai development shouldn t be done in a wild west-like silicon valley vacuum lacking regulatory oversight and accountability. many people want powerful ai tools for science, medicine, productivity, and other benefits,  fli cofounder anthony aguirre said in press release.  but the path ai corporations are taking, of racing toward smarter-thanhuman ai that is designed to replace people, is wildly out of step with what the public wants, scientists think is safe, or religious leaders feel is right.  nobody developing these ai systems has been asking humanity if this is ok,  aguirre added.  we did   and they think it s unacceptable. more on ai regulation:gavin newsom vetoes bill to protect kids from predatory ai"

sure to say the company was not replacing human workers. new documents show that amazon could have new plans to replace the necessity to hire human workers thanks to its robotic progression.robots take overover the years, amazon hasutilized robots and technology advancementsto make its warehouses more efficient and lower its operating costs to help lower costs for consumers and improve operating margins.with sights set on more improvements to efficiency and costs, amazon could be looking to replace future workers with robots.internal documents from amazon, viewed by the new york times, show that the e-commerce giant could turn to robots instead of hiring 160,000 people it needs to maintain the growth of its current and future operations by 2027.trending: amazon and nvidia partnered with this robot chef  now individual investors can tooby replacing the future human workers with robots, amazon would save an estimated 30 cents per item purchased and delivered to customers, according to the documents.with a goal of selling twice as many products as it currently sells by 2033, amazon would need to hire around 600,000 people. the company is hoping that robot advancements mean it won't have to add to its existing workforce in the u.s., potentially replacing those 600,000 future jobs with robots.some of amazon's warehouses already have fewer and fewer humans being utilized thanks to robotic advancements. amazon's ultimate goal is for 75% of its operations to be automated.a document from amazon's robotics team said it was helping to \"flatten amazon's hiring curve over the next 10 years.\" the statement came after an advanced warehouse in shreveport, louisiana, showed that 25% to 50% fewer human workers were needed with more robots used from the beginning. that design is expected to be copied by 40 amazon facilities by the end of 2027.the documents show amazon may already be preparing for the potential fallout from job losses and a lack of future hiring by making greater efforts in community events to instill goodwill with communities that have warehouses.\"the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines   now or moving forward,\" amazon spokespersonkelly nanteltold the new york times in statements viewed by benzinga. \"the facts speak for themselves: no company has created more jobs in america over the past decade than amazon.\"story continuesamazon told benzinga the company will continue to create job opportunities, with an emphasis on higher-paying positions and upskilling programs like its robotics apprenticeship program.the company said efficiency gains have often been used to invest in other areas of the business.amazon may also have executives stop using certain words and phrases such as \"automation\" and \"ai\" in the future, preferring instead to say \"cobot\" to imply robots are working in close collaboration with humans.in the new york times, nantel said the documents viewed were incomplete and not the full picture of the e-commerce giant's future hiring goals. nantel said amazon plans to hire 250,000 people for the 2025 holiday season, but declined to say if any of those holiday roles would be permanent.amazon told the new york times that it does not have any words or

\"once they work out how to do this profitably, it will spread to others, too.\"acemoglu, who won the nobel prize in economic science in 2024, said amazon could quickly go from best to among the worst in employment.\"one of the biggest employers in the united states will become a net job destroyer, not a net job creator.\"amazon is the second-largest employer in the u.s., hiring hundreds of thousands of workers nationwide in recent years. the company's workforce is around 1.2 million employees in the u.s., more than tripling since 2018.in july, amazon said that it is offering training for employees to learn robotics management and offering career paths alongside its robotic advancements.amazon acquired robotic companykiva systemsin 2012 for $775 million. kiva changed its name to amazon robotics in 2015 and has been a large focus of the e-commerce company's automation efforts since then.the acquisition could end up being one of the most important in amazon's history as the e-commerce giant gets closer to having more robots employed than humans.photo: amazon employee with mobile robot, courtesy amazontrending now:accredited investors can now tap into the$36 trillion home

    "text": "brussels   intelligence agencies across europe are burying decades of distrust and starting to build a shared intelligence operation to counter russian aggression   a move accelerated by the new american capriciousness in supporting its traditional allies.in the past year, many national capitals have embedded intelligence officials in their brussels representation offices. the european union's in-house intelligence unit has started briefing top-level officials. and the bloc is toying withthe idea to build up stronger, cia-style powers  long considered unthinkable.the push for deeper intelligence cooperation accelerated sharply after the trump administration abruptly halted the sharing of battlefield intelligence with kyiv last march.advertisementdonald trump \"deserves a nobel peace prize for bringing the services of europe together,  said one western intelligence official, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of how they cooperated with american counterparts.politico spoke with seven intelligence and security officials who described how the rupture in transatlantic trust is driving europe s spy agencies to move faster   and closer   than ever before.it's all part of a bigger reconsideration of practices. european intelligence services have also started reviewing more closely how they share information with u.s. counterparts. the dutch military and civil intelligence services toldlocal paper de volkskranton saturday they'd stopped sharing certain information with their u.s. counterparts, citing political interference and human rights concerns.officials fear that transatlantic forums, including the defense alliance nato, will become less reliableplatforms to share intelligence.  there is a sense that there could be less commitment on the part of the united states in the months to come in sharing the intelligence they have   both inside nato and at large,  said antonio missiroli, the former assistant-secretary general for emerging security challenges at nato.security services are still overcoming decades-old trust issues.new revelationsthat hungarian intelligence officials disguised as diplomats tried to infiltrate the eu institutions show how governments within the eu still keep close watch over each other.to cope with the distrust, some leading spy agencies are pushing to set up groups of trusted countries instead of running things through brussels.advertisementclub de berneunlike tight-knit spy alliances like the five eyes, european union member countries have long struggled to forge strong partnerships on intelligence sharing. national security remains firmly in the hands of national capitals, with brussels playing only a coordinating role.one way european services have communicated traditionally is through a secretive network known as the club de berne, created nearly 50 years ago in the swiss city it is named after. the club has no headquarters, no secretariat and meets only twice a year.in recent years, the group has coordinated its meetings to roughly align with the rotating presidency of the council of the european union. but the club is hardly a mirror image of the eu. malta has never joined, bulgaria only recently signed on, and austria was suspended for a time over concerns it was too soft on moscow before being readmitted in 2022. non-eu countries such as switzerland, norway and the u.k. are also members.donald trump \"deserves a nobel peace prize for bringing the services of europe together,  said one western intelligence official, who was granted anonymity to disclose details of how they cooperated with american counterparts. | anna moneymaker/getty images club de berne is an information sharing architecture a bit like europol. it's designed to share a certain kind of information for a particular function,  said philip davies, director of the brunel centre for intelligence and security studies in london.  but it s fairly bounded and the information that's being shared is potentially quite anodyne because you're not plugging into secure systems and [there are] national caveats. major european union intelligence players   france, the netherlands, germany, and until 2019, the u.k.   saw little value in sharing sensitive information with all eu countries, fearing it could fall into the wrong hands.eastern european services, like bulgaria's, were believed to be filled with russian moles, said missiroli. one bulgarian security official argued that was no longer the case, with the old guard largely retired.advertisementbut while it offered some mode of collaboration, the club de berne also left brussels' eu-level officials largely in the dark.  the problem with talking about european intelligence sharing is that european intelligence sharing is not the same thing as eu intelligence sharing,  said davies.calling on the eurecent geopolitical shifts have forced the european union to rethink its approach. former finnish president sauli niinist  called last year for the eu to create acia-style agency, coordinated from brussels, in a landmark preparedness report at the request of commission president ursula von der leyen.niinist  laid out the idea of a  fully fledged intelligence cooperation service at the eu level that can serve both the strategic and operational needs,  while adding that  an anti-sabotage network  is needed to protect infrastructure.if there is such a thing as a collective eu intelligence agency, the european union's in-house intelligence and situation centre (intcen) at the european external action service (eeas) is the closest to it. the center conducts analysis based on the voluntary contributions by eu countries. spies from national agencies do secondments at the center, which helps building up ties with national intelligence.croatian intelligence chief daniel marki  took over the helm of intcen in september 2024 on a mission to beef up information-sharing with the agency and get direct intelligence to eu leaders like von der leyen and foreign policy chief kaja kallas.together with its military counterpart   the eu military staff intelligence directorate   the two services form the single intelligence analysis capacity (siac), which produces shared intelligence assessments for eu decision-makers. in april, siac held its annual meeting in brussels, this time drawingtop officials of the european agenciesto attend, along with kallas.advertisementspy chiefs at that meeting underlined a growing push for europe to build its own independent intelligence capabilities. but some also worried that overemphasizing the need for autonomy could further weaken ties with the u.s., creating the very gaps europe is trying to avoid.trust issuesslowly but surely, brussels is building up its own intelligence community. for instance, intelligence liaison officersnow exist in most permanent representations of eu member countries in brussels.the belgian security services (vsse), which are officially tasked with overseeing spying activities around the eu institutions in brussels, have also briefed members of the european parliament on tactics used to coerce lawmakers into foreign espionage.still, one european intelligence source told politico that while cooperation between eu countries was now  at its best in modern history,  agencies still work first and foremost for their own national governments.that is a key stumbling block. according to robert gorelick, the retired head of mission of the u.s. cia in italy,  the reason that an eu-wide intelligence service couldn t exist is that there is too much variety in how national agencies work.\" what's worse, he added:  there are too many countries   27   for there to be such trust in sharing. some countries have leaned toward setting up smaller ad hoc groups. after the u.s. paused its intelligence sharing with ukraine in march, a coalition of the willing led by france and the united kingdom met in paris and agreed to expand kyiv's access to european-operated intelligence, surveillance technology and satellite data.advertisementthe netherlands is looking at beefing up cooperation with other european services, like the united kingdom, poland, france, germany and the nordics   including sharing raw data.  that has been scaled up enormously,  erik akerboom, the head of the dutch civil intelligence service, told de volkskrant.yet there is still a long way to go to build enough trust between 27 eu members with differing national priorities. in october,it was revealedthat hungarian intelligence officials disguised as diplomats tried to infiltrate eu institutions while oliv r v rhelyi (now a european commissioner) was hungary's ambassador to the bloc, and place orb n cronies in key positions.niinist , who wrote the eu's preparedness report last year, told politico in an interview this month that a full-fledged eu intelligence agency was still  a question of the future. he added:  it comes to the word trust when we talk about preparedness, because without trusting we can't cooperate very much."

    "text": "twitterfacebookemailhuman-written code is facing stiff competition from ai-generated evolutionary code.credit: mtstock studio/gettyresearchers at google haveunveileda new workflow to improve scientific software using artificial intelligence1.the company built evolutionary  trees  of software tools for six tasks. the  nodes  in each tree were single programs whose performance was assessed using a standard benchmark. the team created new nodes by prompting alarge language model(llm) to improve an existing one s performance. the researchers helped the llm by feeding it summaries of research papers, specialist knowledge and other information. in each task, some of the resulting programs outperformed state-of-the-art tools. it s really cool to see big companies like google using evolutionary approaches to make breakthroughs in other scientific fields,  says jenny zhang, a computer scientist at the university of british columbia in vancouver, canada, who has designed programs using similar methods.  it gives me hope that the research direction that i m doing, when scaled up, can make a big impact. google researchers answered questions fromnatureabout the work but declined to comment on the record because the manuscript has not yet been peer reviewed. the team is working to make the system available to scientists, the authors say. many of the optimized tools can be foundonline.software evolutionscience runs on software. researchers need code to analyse big data, simulate complex processes and operate sophisticated instruments. last year s nobel prize in chemistry was awarded, in part, foralphafold, a platform that predicts how proteins will fold up. and many of this century smost-cited papersdescribe research software.but writing scientific software is time-consuming and technical.  when i m actually focused on science, 90% of my time is coding,  says evan johnson, a biostatistician and director of the center for data science at rutgers university in piscataway, new jersey, who was not involved in the work. google s new workflow aims to automate the process by allowing software to evolve, building on both existing tools and online resources.google refined its code-mutation system by having it complete tasks that had been published on the data-science competition platform kaggle, testing ways to choose nodes to mutate or to prompt the llm to alter them. then the researchers applied the method across six scientific domains. for each one, they grew several evolutionary trees, each with up to 2,000 nodes. they created the initial node of a tree by asking the llm to write a program from scratch, telling it to implement an existing method, combine two methods or create a new one. when mutating a program, the llm could also search the literature for fresh ideas. it was allowed to duplicate and  mutate  any node in the tree, not just the best-performing one, leading to an open-ended discovery process in which evolution could take meandering paths to success.the first application was  batch integration of single-cell rna-sequencing data    that is, merging different genomics data sets. the system generated 40 programs that outperformed the best human-written program available, called combat, developed by johnson. the top-scoring program was 14% better. next, they used evolution to refine programs to predict the number of covid-19 hospitalizations across us states. their best predictors outscored all others in the covid-19 forecast hub, a repository of forecasting models.other tasks included labelling satellite images, predicting neural activity in zebrafish (danio rerio) and  time-series forecasting : projecting how data points from various domains progress over intervals ranging from seconds to years. in all three cases, evolved programs beat existing ones. in the final challenge, google created variations of a common function to solve calculus problems. the best one attempted 19 problems that the original had failed   and solved 17 of them.time-savers i think it s exciting that they could potentially outperform humans without even thinking about it,  johnson says. according to the preprint, the system reduces  exploration of a set of ideas from weeks or months to hours or days .johnson offers two notes of caution, however, both of which apply to any kind of automated code-generation system, he says. the first is that ai might violate software licences through plagiarism. the second is that if users don t understand the code and sufficiently oversee its generation, it could be fragile or untrustworthy. xutao wang, a computational biologist who works with johnson at rutgers, adds,  let ai help you make a better solution instead of creating one for you. zhang counters such concerns by noting that alphago, google deepmind sgo-playing algorithm, started learning by imitating human players, but a later   and better   version calledalphago zerolearnt only by playing against itself. in evolving scientific software, the llm was often prompted to take inspiration from human-written work. but with more computing resources, the system might be able to abandon the constraints of human guidance and do even better, zhang says.in fact, the software has already shown signs of going beyond iteration and recombination. some of the evolved programs for pandemic prediction demonstrated  significant conceptual leaps  beyond other such models, the paper notes.  ultimately, this demonstrates the power of [evolutionary] search as a scientific discovery engine.

take just 30 seconds and sign up for wnd's email news alerts!part of the president s rationale is that venezuela s socialist government under dictator nicolas maduro is killing americans by profiting from illicit narcotics, especially cocaine. a state departmentreportreleased in march named venezuela as  a major drug transit country. having destroyed the oil-rich nation s economy with confiscatory socialist policies, the maduro government has become a major player in drug distribution by home-grown gangs such as tren de aragua, who execute anyone in their way.concerns over a president s legal use of military power are not to be dismissed lightly, but here s something about which the media have developed amnesia. from 2020 to 2024, a total of more than 503,000 americans died from drug overdoses, the majority of them from fentanyl, a synthetic opioid often mixed with cocaine or heroin.the current prediction is for about 76,000 deaths in 2025, according to health officials. add this to the previous five years  toll and it comes to nearly 580,000 dead americans.that exceeds the populations of major cities such as albuquerque, baltimore, milwaukee, miami, or atlanta.overdoses remain the leading cause of death for americans aged 18-44.anyone facilitating this carnage is arguably waging war on the united states.fentanyl, which is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin, is created from precursor chemicals made in communist china and shipped to mexican and central american drug cartels.it s partly why the second trump administration levied stiff tariffs against canada and mexico, which he said were indifferent to the fentanyl smuggling that is wreaking havoc in the u.s.he also levied punitive tariffs on china for its precursor trafficking, not to mention its predatory pricing, corporate espionage, cyber terrorism and other hostile actions.in addition to designating several of the drug cartels as global terrorist organizations, the united states has named mr. maduro as an international narco-terrorist.in august, the u.s. state department and the justice department doubled a bounty for information leading to mr. maduro s arrest to $50 million.an estimated 7.7 million venezuelans have fled their country since mr. maduro took over from the cuba-backed marxist leader hugo chavez in 2013. the world seems to be waking up to the maduro regime s crimes, including his stealing of his nation s presidential election in july 2024, crushing dissent and arresting opposition leaders.on oct. 10, the nobel committee awarded the 2025 peace prize to venezuela opposition party leader maria corina machado, who had to flee for her life after the election. the committee cited her  tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. this is one brave lady. mr. trump congratulated her when she called him on the day she won the award. he said she told him he was worthy of the award as well.mr. trump had brokered the abraham accords between israel and several arab nations in 2020. in the past 10 months, he has fostered several more peace agreements, including those between congo and rwanda, india and pakistan, and between israel and hamas in gaza.although some accused the nobel committee of snubbing america s president, nominations for the 2025 peace prize closed on jan. 31, 2025, less than two weeks into mr. trump s second term.unlike former president barack obama, who was given the peace prize in 2009 following what might be called his world america apology tour, mr. trump has actually helped stop or prevent conflicts.mr. trump and communist china leader xi jinping are slated to meet during the asia-pacific economic cooperation (apec) summit in south korea from oct. 31 to nov. 1.although the discussions will center on tariffs and china s stranglehold on rare earth minerals, the middle kingdom is still the source of most precursor chemicals.venezuela and mexico may be america s neighborhood pushers, but china is the global drug lord behind fentanyl. the president should push mr. xi on the precursor issue. while he s at it, he can bring up china s latest vicious crackdown on christian pastors.as for venezuela, we can hope and pray that the people of that once-prosperous and free nation find a way to rid themselves of their socialist curse without involving the u.s. in yet another war.this column was first published at the washington times.robert knightrobert knight is a columnist for the washington times. his website is roberthknight.com.read more of robert knight's articles here.narcoterrorists"

reference to areportinthenew york timesthat alleged maduro has tried to cut a resource deal with washington in order to avoid a military conflict.the legality of these strikes has been questioned by several experts.dan herman, senior director at the washington-based think tank center for american progress, said trump has  no legal authority to conduct these strikes  and noted that the u.s. government has  presented no evidence for its claims.  herman believes these attacks are unlikely to have any meaningful impact on the influx of drugs into the united states.stay in the loopnever miss

traffickers. based on available media reports, there are approximately 10 u.s. navy ships in the caribbean sea, withthree directly off the coast of venezuela. according tomilitary.com, there are also currently  10,000 u.s. troops now operating in the caribbean [who] were sent to interdict drug boats. u.s. foreign policy toward venezuela, under both democratic and republican administrations, has long aimed at regime change. in april 2002, the administration of president george w. bushquickly endorsedthe leadership of pedro carmona, head of the national business federation fedec maras, after a faction of the military kidnapped president hugo ch vez for 47 hours, until he was rescued by loyalist armed forces.there are approximately 10 u.s. navy ships in the caribbean sea, with three directly off the coast of venezuela.since then, the united states has implemented increasingly harsh economic sanctions against venezuela. in 2015, then-president barack obama declaredvenezuela a threat to u.s. national security, a move thatprompted foreign ministers from a coalition of 12 south american nationsto call on washington to revoke the decree. by 2017, u.s. sanctions had tangible effects: a low-income venezuelan family of five could expect toconsume only 6,132 calories per day   1,226 per personif divided equally. earlier this year,the lancetreported that u.s.-led sanctions contribute to an estimated 564,000 deaths across the world each year, with a significant proportion occurring in venezuela.after hugo ch vez s death from cancer in 2013, president nicol s maduro initially struggled to fill the political vacuum. between 2013 and 2019, venezuela saw an80 percent drop in imports, devastating its import-dependent economy. in 2019, the trump administration continued the u.s. trend of throwing its weight behind opposition leaders, this time backing juan guaid , who challenged maduro s 2018 reelection. trump s choice to formally recognize guaid  as interim president signaled a renewed push by the u.s. to overturn the bolivarian government.former secretary of defense mark t. esper, in his autobiographya sacred oath: memoirs of a secretary of defense during extraordinary times, revealed that for trump, regime change in venezuela  seemed to be a bucket list item  and that the u.s. should  get the oil.  in addition to holding thelargest proven oil reserves in the world  approximately 303 billion barrels, or roughly 17 percent of global reserves   venezuela also holds significant gold, iron ore, bauxite, coltan, and diamond deposits.in a 2022 interview with  60 minutes,  esper recounted how during his first term trump repeatedly asked the department of defense about taking more aggressive measures to remove maduro, including direct military action.eventually, trump settled on deploying a u.s. naval fleet to the caribbean under the supposed auspices of fighting drug trafficking. in march 2020, the southern district of new york charged maduro with narco-terrorism andoffereda bounty of up to $15 million for information leading to his arrest or conviction. in july this year, the u.s. department of treasury s office of foreign assets control (ofac)designatedthe cartel de los soles (cartel of the suns) as a terrorist organisation. as of august 7, 2025, the bounty on maduro stands at $50 million, despite the fact that most

(pdvsa). in 2018,machado wrote a letter to the ex-president of argentina mauricio macri and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahuinsisting they use their  strength and influence to advance the dismantling of the criminal venezuelan regime,  which, in her view, were connected to  drug trafficking and terrorism. in caracas, ricardo vaz, editor of venezuelanalysis.com, says life continues as normal, though  there is tension and concern with this u.s. military buildup on venezuela s doorstep.  he notes that while there is awareness of u.s. military might,  there is also defiance,  particularly among the government s core supporters. vaz warns that while the current u.s. presence in the caribbean is insufficient for a full-scale regime change, it has  a lot of potential for destruction, be that from cruise missiles or aircraft, aimed at triggering some internal collapse. adding to these tensions, the trump administration has granted theciaauthorizationto conduct covert operations in venezuela, according tothenew york times.in september, ministers from thecommunity of latin american and caribbean states (celac)held a virtual meeting, denouncing the deployment of u.s. military vessels near venezuela. celac, unlike the u.s.-dominated organization of american states (oas), provides a forum for regional countries to discuss issues without washington s presence, with venezuela, brazil, and mexico playing leading roles.should the united states carry out direct attacks on venezuelan territory, caracas could expect strong diplomatic support from the region despite no longer enjoying the political influence it held under ch vez.venezuela s economy has grown for17 consecutive quarterssince 2021, aided by liberalization measures that have not always been popular with the government s base. in early september, china concord resources corp installed the first self-elevating offshore platform in lake maracaibo. the alala jackup rig isexpected to increase productionfrom 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd by 2026 in the lago cinco and lagunillas lago oilfields in the state of zulia, in western venezuela. a major u.s. military strike could damage the economy, but china s significant investments might complicate any potential targeting of infrastructure.joel linares moreno, a caracas-based fixer for international media outlets, notes that if the trump administration deployed full military force, organized resistance might only last a few days given the huge imbalance of power between the united states military and venezuela s army, air force, and navy. however, linares moreno adds that removing government supporters   known as chavistas   would likely require a force willing to carry out serious human rights abuses.  they know what awaits them is a pinochet-style dictatorship, and that s precisely why they would fight hard, even after the venezuelan military is neutralized,  he said. he warns that the u.s. could  overplay its hand. the coming weeks and months will reveal the trump administration s plans for venezuela and whether maduro and the chavistas can remain in power. it will also highlight whether the governments of venezuela, colombia, brazil, and mexico can gather enough international diplomatic support to halt a u.s.-led war in latin america, which has not been seen since theu.s. invasion of panamain late 1989. that military operation, like the current one in the caribbean sea, was based on a string of falsehoods.trump is aiming to stifle and defund nonprofits.progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in trump s crosshairs.with the aim of eliminating political opposition, trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.we re concerned, because truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks. nevertheless, we refuse to be intimidated or forced to back down.we continue to publish fearlessly and independently thanks to direct reader support.that s why we ve launched a fundraising campaign with a goal to raise $18,000 in the next 24 hours.resist the right-wing agenda: make a tax-deductible one-time or monthly donation to truthout now!truthout"

is it part of the war on drugs?werethe boats ferrying deadly drugs to our shores? is this prelude, whether justified or contrived, to a regime-change war against venezuela and now, possibly, colombia?these questions are hard to answer, in part because the trump administration has furnished so few details about the operations andnoevidence supporting its fist-bumping claims. after the first sinking, on sept. 3, secretary of defensepete hegsethcrowed,  we smoked a drug boat, and there s 11 narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean, and when other people try to do that, they re going to meet the same fate. what other person in hegseth s position has ever talked like this, especially in describing the rather effortless action of a superpower with a $1 trillion military budget going up against a small boat that didn t get off a single shot, if it was armed to begin with?but quite apart from his juvenile braggadocio, neither hegseth nor anyone else offered the slightest evidence that the boat was carrying drugs. even if it was, that doesn t make them  terrorists,  in the same sense as isis or al-qaida (hegseth likened them explicitly) or justify killing them.manyretired officers, including military lawyers, have said that there isno legal justificationor tactical need to do what the administration has done seven times now. even if these were drug smugglers, and even if they were carrying illicit narcotics to american shores (another uncertainty), international law draws a clear line between criminals and terrorists, which, in order to justify the use of deadly force, have to be part of an organized armed group.advertisementadvertisementadvertisementadvertisementa telling fact, unmentioned by the administration (and unreported by most news media): a couple of weeks after the first boat-bombing, theu.s. coast guard seized the largest haul of narcotics in its history 76,140 pounds, having a value of $473 million, enough to supply 23 million lethal doses in 19 interdictions in the caribbean and eastern pacific. the coast guard did this not by blasting the drug boats, but in the usual way halting the boats, boarding them, seizing the drugs, and arresting the smugglers. in 2022, the most recent year for which there is complete data, the coast guard seized105 tonsof illegal narcotics in this way.by any measure, the seven boats, even if they were loaded to the brim with drugs (and they may well have been), are small potatoes by comparison. as he often does,trump exaggerates the effect of his boat-sinking operation, saying that each boat had enough fentanyl onboard to kill 25,000 americans, so if three or 11 venezuelans were killed in the process, the trade-off is worth it. actually, very little fentanyl comes from venezuela, but let s say all of it does. trump s math still makes no sense.about 80,000americans died in 2023 from overdose of opioids (mainly fentanyl). if trump s claim were true, sinking three boats solves our drug epidemic but of course it still exists.advertisementadvertisementthere s another sign that the administration is playing loose with the facts. in the pentagon s latest bombing of an alleged drug-smuggling boat,two of the people onboard were rescued,briefly detained, then extradited to their home countries. this incident raises some interesting questions.first, if the captured men really were drug smugglers, certainly if they were  terrorists,  the standard practice would have been to arrest them, and maybe send them to guantanamo bay or some other military prison. in this case, even a mediocre defense lawyer could have kept them out of jail, and probably even evaded a trial, because there was no evidence that they were drug smugglers; the evidence was on the boat, which (in hegseth s language) had been  smoked  to the bottom of the sea.advertisementonce they get home, they will of course spread the news far and wide that they were just poor fishermen bombed or shelled by reckless american imperialists. in fact, they, as well asrelatives of some of those killed, are claiming (truthfully or not) just that.advertisementsecond, and more intriguing still: who rescued these guys? was it someone from special forces or the navy or a coast guard vessel that happened to be nearby? certainly the good samaritans must have known the two boatmen were not going to be put on trial, owing to lack of evidence. was the rescuemeantto demonstrate that something s not quite right about this whole boat-bombing enterprise? does it reflect a schism within the military over its propriety?advertisementadvertisementit is worth noting, in this context, thatadm. alvin holsey, commander of u.s. southern command, which runs all military operations in that region (including the caribbean), stepped down last week, after just one year on the job the only time in recent memory that any flag officer has quit a command post so soon. a retired admiral, who is plugged in to ongoing activities, told me on background that holsey had raised questions to top pentagon officials about the legality of the boat-sinkings.advertisementwas holsey fired for raising those questions? did he resign in quiet protest rather than follow orders that he saw as unlawful? the democratic members of the house armed services committeewant to call holsey to testify; they need a couple of republicans to support the effort. will trump, hegseth, and house speaker mike johnson block the move? watch that space. then again, maybe it s a coincidence. maybe holsey, who is black, was canned because hegseth figured he d been promoted because of dei. (it wouldn t be the first time.)advertisementthese operations may have less to do with stopping drugs than with laying the groundwork for a war against venezuelan dictator nicol s maduro. trump has pretty much acknowledged that such a war has begun,admitting to reporters that the cia is conducting  covert operations  against his regime though admitting this publicly sort of takes the  c  out of  covert. advertisementadvertisementlet s be clear. maduro is worth overthrowing. he is a brutal dictator. he at least condones, if not actively runs, drug-running operations. more to the point, hemounted a coupto retain political power after he was clearly defeated in an election. (the real winner, and now the leader of the democratic opposition, mar a corina machado, was awarded the nobel peace prize for her courage and integrity.she publicly supports regime-change efforts and has praised trump for leading the way.)still, if the idea of the mission is to restore law, order, and democracy, it should be done in orderly ways. (even cia covert operations have oversight procedures through the house and senate leaders and the top members of the select committees on intelligence.) turning the caribbean into a free-fire zone,  smoking  boats that might be carrying drugs (or doing so without revealing the evidence to that effect), and citing the need to halt drug smuggling (an electorally appealing issue) as an excuse to start a war, without explaining why such a war is in our national interest this is the sort of prelude that leads up to a very bad war.advertisementmaduro is mobilizing his reserves to stave off an american invasion. he says that  millions  of venezuelans are prepared for the fight which is no doubt an exaggeration, but warning cries of an imminent foreign invasion are a familiar way for unpopular tyrants to shore up domestic support. and maduro isn t crying wolf. besides acknowledging a cia covert operation afoot,trump has casually raised the possibility that he might indeed strike venezuela by land.advertisementadvertisementadvertisementtrump is still pissed that he didn t win the nobel peace prize. he has complained about the loss to everybody he s talked to lately tothe crowd of senior officers, to theisraeli knesset, on his phone call withvladimir putin, hismeeting with volodymyr zelensky. if he wants to know why he lost, he should read the transcripts of what he s been saying lately about venezuela, colombia, and, while he s at it,portland and chicago.a peacemaker, which is what he says he wants to be, doesn t talk so volubly and casually about making war, especially unnecessary wars wars whose issues could be settled in otherways.get the best of news and politicssign up for slate's evening newsletter.thanks for signing up! you canmanage your newsletter subscriptionsat any time.you're already subscribed to the the slatest newsletter. you canmanage your newsletter subscriptionsat any time.we encountered an issue signing you up. please try again, ormanage all your newsletter subscriptions here.please enable javascript to sign up for newsletters.email address:send me updates about slate special offers.by signing up, you agree to ourprivacy policyandterms.sign upcopy linksharesharecommentdonald trumpmilitaryslate plusvenezuelaadvertisement"

    "text": "institute professor mildred  millie  dresselhaus forever altered our understanding of matter the physical stuff of the universe that has mass and takes up space. over 57 years at mit, dresselhaus also played a significant role in inspiring people to use this new knowledge to tackle some of the world s greatest challenges, from producing clean energy to curing cancer. although she became an emerita professor in 2007, dresselhaus, who taught electrical engineering and physics, remained actively involved in research and all other aspects of mit life until her death in 2017. she would have been 95 this november.known as the  queen of carbon,  dresselhaus was most often heralded for her pioneering work with one of nature s most abundant and versatile substances. as a result of her insatiable curiosity about our world and her nearly six-decade career as a scientific explorer, we can thank her for significant leaps in how we think about carbon s various forms and the company it keeps. in her early career, dresselhaus employed a then-new invention laser light to probe carbon s inner workings. she worked to distinguish how, for example, flat sheets of carbon atoms act differently from carbon crystals of three dimensions, especially in the presence of heat, electrons, or a magnetic field. and later she predicted the existence of what we now call carbon nanotubes, sheets of carbon atoms rolled up into minuscule cylinders that can be remarkably adept at conducting electricity.building on dresselhaus s far-reaching foundational research, scientists and engineers have made enormous advances at the nanoscale with structures on the order of one hundred-thousandth the width of a human hair. spherical carbon  buckyballs,  cylindrical carbon nanotubes, and two-dimensional carbon sheets known as graphene have already been used for energy storage, medical research, building materials, and paper-thin electronics, among many other applications. today, these carbon structures continue to be developed for myriad novel uses that often seem taken from the realm of science fiction, including ultrafast quantum computers, efficient desalination devices, and quantum dots with applications in biosensing and drug delivery. for her work she won among other honors the kavli prize in nanoscience, the national medal of science, and the presidential medal of freedom, the highest civilian award given by the united states government.but her journey to mit, and to global leadership in solid-state physics, was an improbable one. born in brooklyn, new york, to immigrant parents in 1930, dresselhaus came of age at a time when women were rarely welcomed as scientists or encouraged to pursue technical fields. yet she benefited from several key mentors who saw her potential and took deliberate steps to support a brilliant young mind.president barack obama presented dresselhaus with the presidential medal of freedom in 2014.olivier douliery/abacapress.com via alamyone of those mentors was enrico fermi, the distinguished italian-born nuclear scientist who played a leading role in the manhattan project and who concluded his career as a professor of physics at the university of chicago. fermi came to america after receiving a solo nobel prize in 1938 (for work on induced radioactivity) and then fleeing the nazi regime with his jewish wife, laura. the story of how fermi influenced an up-and-coming millie dresselhaus and, by proxy, scores of students who would study under her reveals how paying it forward to the next generation of scientists and engineers can yield lasting dividends.in 1953, with the nuclear age firmly underway and the cold war heating up, dresselhaus found herself, at 22, one of the new graduate students within the university of chicago s world-class physics department. although a number of researchers who had worked on the manhattan project there had by then left for other opportunities, many luminaries remained. in addition to the renowned enrico fermi, notable faculty included the nobel laureates harold urey and maria goeppert mayer (with whom dresselhaus lived for about a year as a boarder) as well as the physicist leona woods, the only woman present during the famous 1942 fission demonstration on one of the school s squash courts.the university s physics program was fairly small in those days: dresselhaus had earned a spot as one of just about a dozen new graduate students that year. she was also, it turns out, the only female student in the department. despite a master s degree in physics from radcliffe college and a fulbright fellowship at the university of cambridge, she felt not quite prepared as she began her phd. and so, at the start of her doctoral studies, she discovered a cache of old examinations, and she worked the problems therein forward and back until she felt up to speed.despite this added practice, the coursework for first-year phd candidates was brutal so brutal that around three-quarters of all entering physics students eventually dropped out of the program. but dresselhaus s relationship with fermi would provide an unexpected boost.she first encountered the unflappable scientist who made crucial strides not only in the development of the atomic bomb but in particle physics after the war as a student in his class on quantum mechanics. and through that class, dresselhaus got to know his teaching style, which she recalled as patient, inspiring, and mind-opening. with a slow, deliberate, accented voice that dresselhaus described as  halting,  fermi expertly distilled complicated topics so that anyone in attendance could comprehend them. brilliant at both theory and experimentation, he delighted in stripping concepts to their essence, and unlike more impatient professors who were absorbed in their own work, fermi cherished the opportunity to review whatever he knew about a physical concept by explaining it to someone else. for this he clearly had a talent; thanks to the way he presented the finer details of quantum mechanics, dresselhaus explained,  any youngster could think, when they heard the lecture, that they understood every word. one key to the eminent scientist s clarity was the ban he placed on taking notes. fermi demanded full attention, so he would prepare and dole out handwritten notes before his lectures, lest students be tempted to take out their pens or slide rules.  what was so impressive and amazing about it is that the lectures were very exciting, whatever the subject was,  dresselhaus said in a 2001 interview.nuclear scientist enrico fermi, shown here circa 1942, was a key early mentor to dresselhaus at the university of chicago.hulton archive/getty imagesand then there was the homework, which was always tricky, but delightfully enlightening once you figured it out. at the end of every class, fermi floated a seemingly simple problem to be solved as an exercise prior to the following lecture. these included questions like: why is the sky blue? why do the sun and stars emit spectra of light? and, famously, how many piano tuners are there in chicago?  you thought it was simple until you got home,  dresselhaus said in 2012, upon receiving the enrico fermi award, a lifetime achievement award given by the us department of energy. these types of questions became known, collectively, as  fermi problems  and are taught today in schools around the world, from kindergarten all the way to graduate-level courses, as examples of how to estimate and triangulate in search of an answer, even when you don t know all the relevant and seemingly necessary parameters. back when dresselhaus was learning about such problems, all she knew was they were due by the next class, no more than a day or two away, and they took a significant effort.  i think we learned a great deal from him in the formulation of problems of physics, how to think about physics, how to solve problems, and how to generate your own problems,  she said.indeed, throughout her career, dresselhaus credited fermi with teaching her how to  think as a physicist.  a key concept behind the fermi system, she often stated, was the idea of single-authorship research: grad students were expected to conceive of, carry out, and publish their thesis work more or less on their own, without the guiding hand of a more senior faculty member. this required them to work with others to develop a broad understanding of physics that they could then apply to a research topic they d generate themselves.fermi s connection with students didn t end in the classroom. he was well known for frequent interactions with young people, and for being the rare senior faculty member who regularly integrated students into his personal life.  it was not beneath him to associate freely with students and to treat them as equals,  said jay orear, a career physicist and graduate student of fermi s, in a book of remembrances about his advisor.  in fact, i think he enjoyed young physics students more than some of his older colleagues. for dresselhaus, this integration began, quite literally, on her way to school. she and fermi lived in the same general vicinity, and both were early risers who walked down ellis avenue on their way to the lab each day.  i had him for class first thing in the morning. and on my way, walking to school, i would see him. and he would cross the street and walk with me,  dresselhaus recalled in a 2007 oral history interview.  that s just being very friendly, and that made a long-term impression on me. dresselhaus shown in conversation early during her tenure at mit. she would spend 50 years as a member of the faculty.margo foote/mit museumwhenever they met, fermi would always select the subject of discussion and would never fail to energize and inspire her.  i was a very shy youngster and wouldn t think of suggesting the topic to enrico fermi,  shetoldmit alumni newsin 2013. he would always ask questions about  what if this and this and this were true? what if we could make this would it be interesting, and what could we learn?  fermi and his wife, laura, were well known for hosting monthly dinners at their house, with dancing afterward and his students were always invited.  fermi especially liked young people,  noted harold agnew, a longtime physicist and one of his graduate students, in a remembrance published after fermi s death.  the top floor of his chicago house had a large room in which he would invite students to come and square-dance.  i remember those dinners,  dresselhaus said in 2012.  laura fermi was a very, very good italian cook.  but more than the cooking, she said,  it was the ambiance and the friendliness in that household that really made us enjoy physics it was something more.  that  something more  would inspire dresselhaus later in her career to provide her own students at mit with a familial atmosphere in the lab, at group luncheons, and at events in her home, where lines between student and professor were blurred a bit and kindred spirits enjoyed one another s company.dresselhaus s acquaintance with fermi would last only a year. he had developed an incurable stomach cancer, possibly a result of exposure to radiation from his earlier work, and died on november 28, 1954. but he left a fantastic impression that influenced her for the rest of her days, instilling in her a commitment to public service and guiding how she trained her own students. the most important thing that young people need is the confidence that they can succeed. that s what i work on.  fermi had the most profound influence on physics teaching in the united states, and our graduate programs ... are much fashioned from his way of teaching,  dresselhaus said in 2001. she later added,  from him, i learned that we don t have to be leaders in every field, but we can use our understanding to see connections that others might miss. the broad physical and scientific knowledge that dresselhaus developed as a result of fermi s system for teaching graduate students helped her in numerous ways throughout her career. it proved useful on several occasions when she had to make significant course corrections, with very little background in the areas into which she pivoted. and she relied on it as a leader of national programs with diverse constituents.but perhaps the grandest lesson that dresselhaus gained from her mentor was an understanding of what it takes to be a great teacher and advocate.  the most important thing that young people need is the confidence that they can succeed,  she explained in 2012.  that s what i work on. when i have students, i make sure they are able to formulate and solve their own problems. i will help them, if they come in and talk with me. and i make sure they receive training for their next job. by all accounts, she more than succeeded in that effort. at mit, she became a beloved professor who both pushed her students to be their very best and provided support in ways big and small to ensure high achievement helping students network for career opportunities, hosting any student who didn t have a place to go for thanksgiving dinner, teaching an entire recitation section for an engineering student who showed great promise but needed help getting up to speed in solid-state physics. she said,  i always felt fermi and rosalyn [yalow, her undergraduate mentor at hunter college] were interested in my career, and i try to show the same concern for my students. in the eight years since dresselhaus s death, new advances from her colleagues have borne the signature of her research and have begun branching out in ever more fascinating directions. graphene, for example, remains one of the hottest topics in science. back in the early and mid-2010s, dresselhaus worked on what she and others called  misoriented graphene.  she and others predicted that by twisting sheets of graphene so that their honeycomb patterns are slightly misaligned when superimposed, researchers could introduce  interesting patterns  that might lead to useful properties. in 2018, dresselhaus s mit colleague pablo jarillo-herrero realized this idea: he and others discovered that if two graphene sheets are combined into a superlattice, aligned at a  magic angle  of 1.1 degrees, the system can become either superconducting or insulating. the development was hailed as a major discovery and marked a jumping-off point for a subfield now known as   twistronics. physics worldnamed it breakthrough of the year.dresselhaus hypothesized that misaligning sheets of graphene could produce novel properties. in 2018, her mit colleague pablo jarillo- herrero demonstrated that such an arrangement can become either a superconductor or an insulator.courtesy of the researchersalso in 2018, mit opened its doors to a gleaming new nanoscience and nanotechnology research facility at the heart of campus. the $400 million mit.nano project was a long time in coming; although dresselhaus missed out on the grand opening, she was very much looking forward to its completion, and to the start of a new generation of nanoscale endeavors at the institute that would seek to expand humanity s understanding of physics, chemistry, materials science, energy, biology, and more. in her final years, dresselhaus had looked to mit.nano as an extension of her legacy.in late 2019, the courtyard between the institute s infinite corridor and the southern fa ade of the mit.nano building was dedicated in her memory. dubbed the improbability walk, the space is a nod to dresselhaus s unlikely rise to international prominence from her humble beginnings in depression-era new york. it also encourages those who might serve as mentors to take time to get to know younger colleagues and students, as enrico fermi did with dresselhaus and dresselhaus did with so many at mit. for as improbable as it might seem, an encouraging word from a mentor can immeasurably enhance a young scientist s life path.like fermi before her, dresselhaus was deeply committed to giving back to students, to her research community, to society at large. throughout her 86-plus years, she gave of her time, her intellect, her energy, her love, and her enthusiasm. in one of her final interviews, the queen of carbon issued a ringing invitation.  we need new science and we need new ideas, and there s plenty of room for young people to come in and have careers discovering those new ideas,  she declared.

school, affirmed for the crowd gathered at richardson auditorium that \"princeton s graduate school is thriving,  with new initiatives and an enduring commitment to transformative scholarship.photo bysameer a. khan/fotobuddypriestley shared the many ways the university is continuing to enhance the graduate student experience with respect to financial support, health and wellness, residential and social life, and professional development.  we invest in our students and their education and scholarship,  he said, drawing applause.among other important measures that have been taken to help all graduate students thrive, priestley noted steps to strengthen faculty-student mentorship, a shared governance modelof the graduate school that includes students for the first time, the peer-mentoring graduate scholars program for first-year graduate students, and gradfutures, the school s professional development program.priestley welcomed kirschner and eisgruber to the stage, and kirschner began their conversation by asking what it was like to be president of princeton at this moment in history.  i think i have the best job in the world,  eisgruber said. while he acknowledged that this is a moment of crisis for higher education, his job, he said, is to communicate why princeton and other universities are important and worth preserving.  there s lots of uncertainty, but there are also certain things we can be confident of, that we know are unchanging and we know are good, and we have to lean into those. the conversation shifted to how eisgruber s leadership style has changed over his nine years as provost and then 12 as president. eisgruber shared that in his current role, he s had to  get better and better at communication,  and that this is part of the reason he wrote the book  terms of respect: how colleges get free speech right,  published on sept. 30.  i think we have to be messaging very aggressively to washington and to the broader public around what it is that we do. conference co-chair ann kirschner *78 (left) joined princeton president christopher l. eisgruber 83in conversation at richardson.photo bysameer a. khan/fotobuddywhen kirschner noted that she s heard many say that they appreciate eisgruber s leadership and noted that  courage is in short supply in higher education,  eisgruber recalled justice louis brandeis  opinion in the 1927 supreme court case whitney v. california, which said that the first amendment presupposes a  courageous, self-reliant  people that is  willing to step up and express your views when it s hard to do so.  the president shared that he thinks institutions of higher education need to focus on getting their messages out to the broader public:  it has harmed us in higher education that we haven t been out there talking   and talking especially to our critics and hearing what it is that they have to say to us. eisgruber stressed the need for both free speech and equality on campus, noting they are recurring themes of his book, and paraphrased brandeis:  the remedy for bad speech is more speech.  he spoke of the need to have civil conversations on campus about tough topics, while supporting diversity and inclusion.other topics included:how a sense of inclusivity has grown for princeton graduate students;the 2025 nobel prize in physiology or medicine, co-awarded to mary brunkow *91, as an example of the long-term  audacious bets  that princeton makes on people and ideas;the ways that princeton is investing in the humanities, including the new princeton university art museum.the conversation concluded with a lively q&a session with the audience, and a surprise for eisgruber: the presentation of a new striped graduate alumni blazer from laurence latimer *01, apga president.art and insightat seeley g. mudd manuscript library on thursday afternoon, alumni toured the  fashion, feminism & fear  exhibition. the idea for the exhibit was sparked in 2020 when co-curator april armstrong *14, who in her role as a collections specialist for the princeton university library manages the special collections blog, wrote a post about the library s collection of editorial cartoons by william h. walker, noting that many of them showed women dressed in pants.walker was a popular cartoonist, contributing to life, harper s, the new york post and other publications, and found the idea of women wearing pants to be ludicrous. most of the cartoons in the exhibit are from 1896, but the exhibition goes beyond walker s cartoons to examine the broader public reaction to the  women in pants  phenomenon. thematic displays illustrated how pants became popular in sports and cycling and how they were perceived as posing a threat of empowerment, as men feared women would take their jobs and positions in society.for the conference tour, the curators also shared primary sources that focused on the history of fashion and gender at princeton, which led to a lively discussion by the group on today s norms for attire. there seems to be just a huge amount of animus, fear and repression involved in what seemingly is a matter of fashion,  said nora odendahl *85, who received her ph.d. in english.  and i think if it were just a quaint historical fact that was buried in the past, it wouldn t have such resonance. but it still affects us deeply. panelists listen as africa world initiative director chika okeke-agulu (far left) speaks on the topic of art acquisitions and repatriation. joining him for the panel (from left) were marykatecleary, curator of provenance at the princeton university art museum,nick napoli *03,an architect and architectural historian, and dora c.y. ching *11, executive director of the tang center for east asian art at princeton.photo bysameer a. khan/fotobuddyon saturday morning, alumni filled a lecture room in robertson hall for a panel discussion titled  whose art is it?: controversies and complexities of art acquisitions and repatriation.   we will admire the beauty of art, but also confront some uncomfortable truths, truths about ownership, identity, interpretation, power, presentation, ethics and justice,  said dora c.y. ching *11, executive director of the tang center for east asian art at princeton, who served as moderator and presented on the buddhist art removed from china by a harvard professor in 1924.  when sacred paintings are removed from their original site and displayed in museums [thousands of miles from the communities], are they preserved or plundered or perhaps both? each of the four panelists gave a presentation, including sharing slides of artwork. nick napoli *03, an architectural historian and practicing architect, spoke on the excavation of pompeii by archaeologist giuseppi fiorelli in the 1860s and 1870s.marykatecleary, curator of provenance at the princeton university art museum, spoke about a piece of indigenous art in the museum s collection that was repatriated in june 2025 to the tlingit and haidi nations in alaska.chika okeke-agulu, director of princeton s africa world initiative and the robert schirmer professor of art and archaeology and african american studies, presented on great britain s invasion of the west african kingdom of benin in 1897, in which more than 5,000 treasures, known as the  benin bronzes,  were taken. from there, they were sold into various museum collections, primarily in the u.k., u.s. and europe.  around 1960, african nations started calling for the return of these looted objects,  he said, noting that progress has been slow.  this is one of the important debates going on in our day. in fact, it is now at the forefront of the so-called culture war. when princeton spia speaksalumni and leaders from the school of public and international affairs (spia) led several panels. on thursday afternoon in mccosh 10, amaney jamal, dean of spia and the edwards s. sanford professor of politics, led the discussion  dialogue in action: leading for the public good.  steven petric *17, the school s assistant dean for global outreach, admissions and alumni engagement, highlighted the priority that spia places on molding leaders skilled at pursuing constructive dialogue across differences.  the ability to remain in conversation even when we disagree is not just a skill but a responsibility for public leaders,  he said.jamal was joined by two spia-trained diplomats: cara abercrombie *03, former acting u.s. deputy under secretary of defense for policy, and ajay bisaria *09, distinguished fellow at the observer research foundation and india s former high commissioner to canada and pakistan and ambassador to poland and lithuania. abercrombie spoke about the importance of finding common ground between parties in defense and military negotiations.  we need to sit down and figure out how to navigate those choppy waters, because the alliance matters,  she said. in troubled relationships, we need more diplomacy. we need more conversations, not less,  said bisaria, who spoke about india-pakistan relations and india s response to the current u.s. tariffs.graduate alumni in the audience asked about the difficulty of applying these principles of civil dialogue to a broader population that has become increasingly polarized. we have an obligation to understand one another,  jamal said.  with social media, you re in this introverted world where you can just talk to yourself. it s not lending itself to the engagement paradigm. we need to reinstall that engagement paradigm in our classrooms, in our homes, in society. similar themes were echoed on saturday morning in the  global governance in an era of geopolitical shifts  panel in arthur lewis auditorium at robertson hall.amid their thoughtful policy discussion on global governance, panelists shared a laugh. shown (from left) are spia graduate alumnisophal ear *97, ileana cruz-marden *19, david goldwyn *86 and steven simon *83.photo bysameer a. khan/fotobuddyled by sophal ear *97, associate professor at arizona state s thunderbird school of global management, the discussion centered on how nationalism, multipolarity and technological change are rewriting the global terms of cooperation.steven simon *83, distinguished fellow and visiting lecturer at dartmouth college, said that the trump administration had backtracked from u.s. policy and international agreements that defined the last 50 years.  [president trump is] very, very suspicious of global government arrangements,  simon said.  rather than seeing these treaties and the accumulation of allies as a force multiplier, as something that enhanced american power on the world stage, he saw treaty partners as parasites, basically, and came to believe that the best thing he could do was provide security on a fee for service basis. david goldwyn *86, president of goldwyn global strategies, llc, and chairman of the atlantic council global energy center s energy advisory group, presented a perspective through the prism of energy policy, which he said is being used  as a tool of coercive diplomacy.  one silver lining is a slow shift to renewables.  what is proving effective post-covid and post russia s invasion of ukraine is decarbonization as either a strategy for competitiveness or financial security,  he said.  you see countries thinking that they need to grow their own energy because they don t want to trust the international system. while the audience, in their questions, expressed concern about the current state of global affairs, ileana cruz-marden *19, director of global partnerships at tent partnership for refugees, struck an optimistic note.  i really do want to see this as an opportunity for us to be creative and innovative,  she said,  and for the next generation of scale leaders to step up and say,  okay, if we are starting from scratch   because in some cases, we will have to   how can we make these organizations more efficient and less bureaucratic so that they are more effective and impactful.   in the service of humanity in a session on \"leadership and public responsibility,\" eddie glaude jr. *97, the james s. mcdonnell distinguished university professor, called for citizens to consider  a view of justice without exception, and then maybe we can figure out a different way of being together, as opposed to being walking mysteries with one another. photo bysameer a. khan/fotobuddyon friday afternoon in mccosh 10, eddie glaude jr. *97, the james s. mcdonnell distinguished university professor, explored themes from his 2024 book,  we are the leaders we have been looking for,  while weaving in elements of his own journey as an intellectual and writer in a session titled  leadership and public responsibility.  my time at princeton in the graduate college, my time in the department of religion was transformative,  said glaude.  i met some of my closest friends and found my intellectual voice, shaped by cornel west, jeffrey stout and the latealbert raboteau, who gave me space to be as brazen, bold and irreverent as i could possibly be. so this place holds a special place in my heart. confronting america s racial history, glaude said,  there s a notion of justice that animates our way of life, which certain communities have for themselves, which they ignore for everyone else. citizens, he said, need to speak honestly about our conception of justice and be consistent.  have a view of justice without exception, and then maybe we can figure out a different way of being together, as opposed to being walking mysteries with one another. over dinner in the poe field tent on friday evening, jos  a. qui onez *98 shared his inspiring personal story. a child immigrant from mexico who  lived in the shadows  until president reagan s 1986 amnesty law, qui onez became the founding ceo of mission asset fund (maf), a san francisco-based financial institution that provides timely, culturally relevant and successful financial products and services to low-income and marginalized immigrant communities.jos  a. qui onez *98 (left) shared his inspiring personal story during an interview with frederick wherry *00 *04.photo bysameer a. khan/fotobuddyinterviewed by frederick wherry *00 *04, vice dean for faculty development and inclusion, director of the presidential postdoctoral research fellows program and townsend martin, class of 1917 professor of sociology, qui onez remembered the many  angels in our midst  who helped him help so many. one was an administrator at the university of california-davis, where he was an undergraduate, who urged him to apply to the princeton graduate school. another was the macarthur foundation, which delivered a  genius  grant in recognition of the maf model he d created.in 2021, when the covid-19 crisis crippled mafs operations, another angel appeared. philanthropist mackenzie scott  92 awarded maf $45 million to provide direct relief to those hit hardest by the pandemic.  she and her staff recognized the work that we were doing in these emergency grants that we were providing to people that were excluded from receiving federal support,  qui onez said.  we put that [money] right to work   to improve their financial lives after the devastating pandemic. reflecting on his life since graduate school at princeton, qui onez said he only wishes that he d dreamed bigger and he exhorted current students to do the same.  look for your angels, look for your helpers,  he said.  don t be afraid to reach out to people, because we re there. even in the midst of this chaotic, crazy moment that we re living through as a country, there are still helpers there. the next generation of scholars and leaderscurrent civil and environmental engineering graduate student caridad estrada said her involvement in student government, gradfutures and mentorship programs has helped her \"to really fly here. photo bysameer a. khan/fotobuddyat  the current graduate experience  panel discussion on friday morning, four princeton graduate students took the stage in richardson auditorium to share what it s like to be on campus today and explain how their experiences extend far beyond their labs and classrooms.javier morales, a fourth-year grad student at the princeton plasma physics lab, talked about how his involvement in the graduate scholars program and community outreach programs at local high schools fortified his confidence as a scientist and reaffirmed his love for the research he s doing. cecelia ramsey, a fourth-year grad student in the french and italian department, recounted how her work with the princeton prison teaching initiative   tutoring incarcerated women in french   has underscored the impact language and literature can make.third-year anthropology grad student nikita taniparti described her transition from economics to anthropology and her work at the university writing center.  when i tell people i love writing, they kind of freak out a bit and ask me how to use ai instead,  she said.  but at princeton, writing is thinking, so i think it s especially important to show them how much writing can open their minds. third-year civil and environmental engineering grad student caridad estrada said that her involvement in student government, gradfutures and mentorship programs has fueled her academic work.  the relationships i ve cultivated with individuals in the administration have given me opportunities to really fly here,  she said.  i ve had interactions that i ll take with me throughout my career. current graduate students and alumni mingled on saturday afternoon in the weickart atrium of the louis a. simpson international building during  find your community: alumni engagement opportunities,  a fair to introduce alumni service programs and connect people with their interests. attendees took advantage of the free headshots offered by a professional photographer and engaged with university staff and alumni volunteers about the princeton prize in race relations, gradfutures, the apga, regional associations, tigernet, and dozens of other alumni volunteer programs and resources.good for businessmolecular biology research in bonnie bassler's lab evolved into a commercial venture for graduate alum justin silpe *20 (right), who told princeton vice dean for innovation craig arnold (left) that the keller center, the national science foundation innovation corps (i-corps) and other resources helped his startup gain traction.photo bysameer a. khan/fotobuddyfriday s lunch conversation, in the event tent on poe field, focused on the translation of academic research into business opportunity. craig arnold, vice dean for innovation and the susan dod brown professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, interviewed justin silpe *20, a princeton molecular biologist-turned-entrepreneur who co-founded pumpkin, a university spin-out company that develops innovations for parents who pump breastmilk.charles goldstein *71, an adviser and investor in the heathcare field, introduced the session by observing how much the climate for entrepreneurship has changed on campus. when he was a chemistry graduate student, he asked the dean about exploring the more  commercial side of things.  the dean briskly replied that princeton was not a business school.  some people said you were selling out if you did such a thing,  goldstein said. now, he noted, the university has the keller center for entrepreneurship and an office of innovation.silpe explained how he founded pumpkin when his baby rejected frozen breastmilk because its taste had changed between pumping and freezing. working in the lab of bonnie bassler, the andrew k. golden university professor of molecular biology and then-chair of the department, silpe began researching food-safe chemistry solutions to the problem. what began with a focus on the science evolved into a commercial venture, in part with the aid of resources including the keller center and the national science foundation innovation corps (i-corps) program, which offers grants and mentorship. princeton also helped the startup with early customer discovery and intellectual property questions, silpe said. taking part in princeton entrepreneurial programs has been amazing because it s personalized [the process] in a way only princeton can do, but then they also connect you to the right people,  he said.at saturday s lunch session, many minds  co-chair and university trustee yan huo *94 said,  one of the great joys of serving in these volunteer roles is that they allow me to stay closely connected with the faculty, administrators, students and alumni and to witness firsthand the exciting and impactful work being carried out on and beyond this campus.  he then introduced sarah nagy *14, a data scientist and founder of the company seekai, and jennifer rexford  91, university provost, the gordon y.s. wu professor in engineering and professor of computer science, for a conversation on the future of artificial intelligence. nagy said she believes ai and human creativity will be complementary.  i don t think ai is creative in that same way humans are,  she said. some jobs will change, she suggested, some will be newly created and some may disappear.  i think ai companies are going to do phenomenally well. i think their customers are going to do really well.   but what happens to everybody else? that's the disequilibrium that needs to be solved. rexford said university settings like princeton can bring interdisciplinary thinking to those challenges,  having people that work on philosophy, ethics, policy, government, interacting with technologists, so that you can do work at those intersections to make sure we figure out the right guardrails. at saturday night s closing dinner, priestley unveiled a new video that celebrates the history of graduate education at princeton   beginning with james madison   and 125 years of the princeton graduate school.  graduate alumni make up nearly one-third of all princeton university alumni,  priestley said in the video.  earning an advanced degree at princeton is a demanding endeavor that requires the best of our students, but a princeton graduate education prepares emerging scholars to lead lives of impact, leadership and service. in his closing remarks, president eisgruber thanked the scores of volunteers   especially  many minds  co-chairs yan huo, ann kirschner and laurence morse   the alumni engagement team,princeton graduate school staff,and the administrative members and princeton departments that made  many minds  such a success. he urged attendees to take the stories they had heard at the conference and share them with the world. he pointed to thestand up for princeton and higher education campaign, which is an initiative engaging princeton alumni, students, faculty, staff and friends to help speak out on behalf of colleges and universities. i m going to be doing everything i can to get the message out there,  said eisgruber, as the audience of cheering guests rose to their feet.  and in these difficult times, i will also tell you this: we are going to be standing up for academic excellence, we are going to be standing up for academic freedom, we are going to stand up for our international students, we are going to stand for diversity, equity and inclusion, and we are going to stand up for the mission of this university. to cap the dinner, the conference steering committee joined graduate student bonnie ko on stage to lead the audience in singing  old nassau. earlier in the conference, apga president laurence latimer told his story about how attending the 2013 graduate alumni conference redefined his relationship with princeton and that he hoped this  many minds  event would do the same for others. after three crisp days on campus, full of debate, discussion and engagement, there were promising signs. i came here after many years, and i just loved the conference,  said nicola walter *92.  it was very stimulating, inspiring and it was great to connect and meet new people. i thought it was exquisitely well organized and just really loved the experience    the variety of topics for lectures and also meeting people from different backgrounds and different departments. i look forward to becoming more involved. sean c. downey, jeff labrecque, catherine mallette and don steinberg contributed to this story."

it means this solar hat doesn't work very well. i tested the hat in the full midday sun in my yard near boston and found that, at best, it generated about 5 watts of power; that's not a lot. it generated 5 volts on the usb port, but the current flow never exceeded 1 amp, meaning it was still only generating about 5 watts of power. in the morning or afternoon, when the sun was at a certain angle, the current generated fell to less than 0.3 amps, approximately 2 watts. ecoflow claims it can generate up to 12 watts but i never managed anything near that.best portable solar panels for 2025see at cnet100 hours to charge an iphone 17 proto test it further, i conducted an arduous gardening session. well, okay, i stuck it on a pole, connected it to ahefty portable power bankand watched from the deck to make sure my local groundhog (we call him wilbur thewhistle pig) didn't steal it. after six hours of this backbreaking work, the charge level had increased by 9%, representing about 225 mah of stored charge. that's about 5% of the capacity of aniphone 17 pro, so this hat would take about 100 hours to charge the phone. that's assuming the phone is not running at the time.the power hat needs 100 hours to charge an iphone 17 pro, if the phone is off.richard baguely/zooey liao/cnetspecstwo sizes: medium-large (56-58 centimeters) and large-xl (59-61 centimeters)dual usb-a and usb-c ports for charging two devices simultaneously.has eight tiny solar panels on the brim.upf 50+, sun and uv protectionclaims 24% thermal-to-electricity conversion and up to 12 watts of power; tested to just 5 wattsip65 waterproof and dustproof-ratedbuying advice: skip, there are better hats and better solar charging options out therebuy the ecoflow power hat on amazonmany of the products i test end up being a case of a great idea but poor execution. the practicalities of manufacturing products and the compromises of real-world engineering often undermine the intended purpose of the product. however, at $129 full price or $99 on sale if youbuy direct from ecoflow, ecoflow power hat is one of the rare exceptions that is a bad idea with bad execution.it's ugly and has solar panels that are too small to be effective for, well, anything. it might be better if they went with aflat cap design, or asaharaorhiking hat designwith the solar panels on the top or neck flap instead. it's also an inferior solution to simply getting afast and compact portable charger, like theinfinitylab instago 5000oranker 523 powercore slim 10k pd. another alternative is using a largerportable solar panel, which you can pair witha power stationor attach to your backpack as you hike to charge your devices, as with thebluetti handsfree 2.buy the bluetti handsfree 2 on amazonbuy the instago 5000 on amazonbuy the anker 523 powercore slim 10k pd on amazonall of these options will provide you with more power than the ecoflow solar hat, and they'll do it better and faster. so keep the solar panels off your head andstick 'em on your roof instead."

    "text": "media kit: full report, methodology, graphs, b-roll and soundbitesorange, calif., oct. 21, 2025 (globe newswire) -- chapman university today released the results of its 11th annualchapman university survey of american fears, a nationally representative look at what americans fear most, and how those fears shape public life, decision-making, and emotional well-being.the 2025 survey finds that  corrupt government officials  has remained america s top fear for the past 10 years, with 69% of respondents reporting they are afraid or very afraid of corruption in government. other leading fears include a loved one becoming seriously ill (58.9%), economic or financial collapse (58.2%), and cyber-terrorism (55.9%).while these findings reflect real and persistent concerns, the survey s lead researcher, dr. christopher bader, chair and professor of sociology at chapman university, emphasizes that fear itself is a complex and revealing measure of how americans see the world. understanding what we re afraid of isn t about stoking anxiety   it s about putting those fears into context,  said dr. bader.  often, the events that capture the most media and social media attention are rare and unusual. but because they re highlighted so vividly and so often, they can feel like daily threats. recognizing that difference helps us regain perspective   and power   over our own emotions. putting fear in perspectivethe survey team notes that many fears have less to do with reality and more to do with perception, particularly as traditional and social media amplify dramatic, infrequent events. although crime rates have steadily declined over the past several years, the survey shows that fear of crime continues to rise. similarly, fears about global conflict and economic collapse fluctuate sharply from year to year, often tracking the tone of national discourse more than real-world data. people have greater access to information than ever before, but they re also more exposed to commentary and imagery designed to evoke emotion,  said dr. edward day, associate professor of sociology.  understanding how fear works helps us distinguish between what feels dangerous and what actually is. from fear to action: how to regain balancedrawing from decades of social science research, the chapman research team (team fear) offers several strategies for managing fear in healthy and productive ways   many drawn fromfear itself: the causes and consequences of fear in america, co-authored by dr. bader. these include:limiting screen time and media exposure to avoid constant exposure to alarming content.facing fears through learning and preparation, which engages reason over instinct.building social connections, since isolation heightens fear while community reduces it.recognizing manipulation, whether in political rhetoric or consumer messaging, that exploits fear to influence behavior. when we step back and understand what s behind our fears, we can make better decisions, as individuals and as a society,  said dr. bader.  fear can motivate us, but it shouldn t mislead us. our goal is to encourage thoughtful awareness, not alarm. chapman university senior and student researcher maddie southern, who worked on the project, and said,  i hope it makes people think about the fact that they are not alone in these fears. i think a lot of people, the reason they become so afraid of these different fears is just because they feel alone. isolation makes people anxious, a lot more fearful. seeing that so many others are afraid of these things is a good way to build community, find resilience in these times that might be economically challenging, political challenging. about the surveythe chapman university survey of american fears is conducted annually by the university s wilkinson college of arts, humanities, and social sciences, a collaboration between the ludie and david c. henley social sciences research laboratory and the earl babbie research center. this year s survey was conducted by ssrs using a probability-based national sample of 1,015 adults, with a margin of error of  3.6%.the full 2025 report, including

no, but you don't do difficult things by only doing what's 100% certain. you do difficult things by trying. and that's what the president of the united states has asked us to do. vance s trip to israel comes at a fraught moment. the israel-hamas ceasefire negotiated this month by president donald trump has been followed by both sides accusing each other of breaching the truce,israeli strikesand adiminished hamasattempting to reassert its authority over the enclave.vance accused american media of overreacting to the setbacks. i want to say that there is this weird attitude i ve sensed in the american media and the western media, where there s almost this desire to root for failure   that every time something bad happens, and every time there s an act of violence, there s this inclination to say,  oh, this is the end of the ceasefire, this is the end of the peace plan,   vance said.  it s not the end. it is, in fact, exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time. we are doing very well. we are in a very good place. an enduring ceasefire is key to trump s ambitions ofwinning the nobel peace prize, making vance s efforts this week to ease tensions and project confidence potentially consequential to the legacy of the man he will likely run to succeed in 2028. hovering over the news conference was atuesday morning truth social postby trump, who wrote that middle east allies  would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into gaza with a heavy force and  straighten [out] hamas  if hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us.  there is still hope that hamas will do what is right,  trump added.  if they do not, an end to hamas will be fast, furious, & brutal! trump says hamas will be 'eradicated' if it doesn't adhere to ceasefire02:18asked about the president s posture, vance reinforced that  very bad things are going to happen  and that hamas would  be obliterated  if it does not cooperate with terms of the ceasefire. but i m not going to do what the president of the united states has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult,  vance said.  so my point is, i don t think it s actually advisable for us to say this has to be done in a week, because a lot of this work is very hard. vance added that he believed middle east allies, including  our israeli friends,  are showing a  certain amount of impatience with hamas.  but we re going to keep on working at this process,  vance said,  and we re going to keep on trying to bring the deceased hostages home, but also make sure that all gazans are able to live in a prosperous and safe place. hamas returned the bodies of two more hostages via the red cross on tuesday, according to the israel defense forces. two coffins of deceased hostages, escorted by idf troops, crossed the border into the state of israel a short while ago and are on their way to the national institute for forensic medicine, where identification procedures will be carried out,  the idfsaid on x.if the bodies returned by hamas on tuesday are confirmed to be hostages, then the bodies of 13 deceased hostages still remain in gaza.vance was joined tuesday by steve witkoff, trump s special envoy to the middle east, and jared kushner, the president s son-in-law.both played key rolesin negotiating the ceasefire, while vance has been dispatched to demonstrate the administration s commitment to it. i want to echo what the vice president said about how a lot of people are getting a little hysterical about different incursions one way or the other,  kushner said.  but what we are seeing is that things are going in accordance   both sides are transitioning from two years of very intense warfare to now a peacetime posture. vance described his visit in part as a fact-finding mission that will help inform the u.s. continued role in the process rather than a reaction to the recent violence that has erupted. it s one thing to read about it, it s one thing to talk with jared and steve on the phone about what s going on on the ground,  the vice president said.  it s another thing to actually shake somebody s hand, to look them in the eye and to understand what are the challenges, what are the things they need from me. henry j. gomezhenry j. gomez is a senior national political reporter for nbc news"

    "text": "amazon is planning to replace hundreds of thousands of jobs with robot workers,according tothe new york times.citing internal documents and interviews with sources, the publication reports that amazon is hoping to have robots replace more than 600,000 u.s. jobs it would otherwise have to fill by 2033. thenytnotes that this would work out to savings of about 30 cents on each item that amazon picks, packs and delivers to customers.on top of that, amazon is reportedly aiming to eventually automate 75 percent of its operations. these automation plans would supposedly save amazon as much as us$12.6 billion (about c$17.6 billion) between 2025 and 2027. as thenytnotes, this comes amid amazon s aggressive cost-cutting plans that were initiated in 2021 by andy jassy once he took over as ceo from jeff bezos.of course, amazon knows such automation plans would be met with great controversy, especially as the cost of living rises across the board. to that point, thenytreports that amazon is actually considering ways to bolster its image as a  good corporate citizen  in response to the inevitable backlash. this includes increased participation in charitable community projects and using vague terms like  advanced technology  and  cobot  (to suggest that robots are workingalongsidehumans instead of replacing them).when reached for comment by thenyt, the company claimed these leaked documents were incomplete and don t represent its broader hiring strategy. the spokesperson added that the company is set to hire 250,000 people this holiday season alone, although they didn t confirm how many of these positions would be permanent vs. seasonal.all in all, this is a pretty concerning report, validating long-running fears of automation replacing jobs en masse. and while this is only the u.s. for now, it s easy to see how it could extend to other countries, like canada, either directly from amazon or indirectly through influencing other companies. here at home, we ve already seenamazon cease operations in quebecafterwarehouse workers unionized.one expert thatthe new york timesspoke to in its feature summed this all up rather well.  once they work out how to do this profitably, it will spread to others, too,  said mit professor and nobel prize winner daron acemoglu. as he tells it, amazon would become a  net job destroyer  should these plans come to fruition.source:the new york times"

2025thandika mkandawire and the decolonization of settler colonial thinking0 comments| 2 sharesestimated reading time: 6 minutes2sharesprofessor kate meagherhighlights how thandika mkandawire s work challenges the idea that settler colonialism produced  good institutions,  revealing instead how it entrenched racial hierarchies, dispossession, and enduring structural injustices that continue to shape contemporary development and global politics.thandika mkandawire, the late chair of african development at the lse and celebrated professor in id, had a knack for taking trending development perspectives and turning them on their head to reveal how they are experienced by people of the global south. reading his work on settlercolonialism and institutionsis something of an  aha moment , triggering a gestalt shift that reveals what development looks like to those at the receiving end. thandika s insights challenge the reigning perspective of nobel-prize winning scholars, daron acemoglu, simon johnson and james robinson (affectionately known as ajr is id circles), who are credited with rehabilitating settler colonialism by distinguishing it from the violent and extractive practices of colonialism in areas less hospitable to european settlement. in theirseminal articleon the subject, ajr argued that settler colonialism, in contrast to its nasty extractive variant, implanted  good institutions  associated with secure property rights, the rule of law, and democratic governance, which have driven successful development over the centuries.revisiting the experience of settler colonialism in africa, thandika s work raises questions about who settler colonial institutions were good for, and whether the settler era is as shrouded in the past as often suggested. reflecting on settler colonialism through the prism of thandika s life and work provides an ideal opportunity to highlight hisiconic research on african developmentto a new cohort of id students, and, in the spirit of black history month, shows how engagement with the histories of the colonized can contribute to deepening and decolonizing contemporary development debates.settler colonialism: whose rights count?both in his research andin his life experience, thandika exposed a very different side of settler colonialism from that associated with ajr. born in southern africa in 1940, thandika spent the first two decades of his life under british colonial rule, experiencing what it was like to be on the wrong side the  good institutions  of british settler colonies. as a child, he experienced forced removals in colonial rhodesia, remembering being uprooted and transported in the rain, shivering with cold. as a teenager, thandika was involved in protests against british imperialism and faced the brutal reprisals that followed. thandika s experience and research remind us that british settler colonialism, in south africa, rhodesia, kenya and so many other colonies, was not so long ago, and that the institutions it spawned, which denied property rights, political rights and security to the majority of the population, were, from an african perspective, difficult to characterize as  good institutions .looking beyond ajr s sanitized history of transplanting institutions, like an exercise in english country gardening, thandika examined how settler colonialism reshaped the nature of states, indigenous institutions and citizenship rights in ways that advantaged some, while dispossessing and repressing others. in his 2010 article  on taxation and colonial heritage , thandika details how settler colonial institutions gave rise to more bureaucratically capable states adept at taxation and social welfare provisioning, but also more extractive and oppressive of local populations. settler colonial states embedded racial hierarchies that suppressed and criminalized local economic and social institutions that might disrupt the flow of labour to settler farms and mines, while subjecting local populations to heavy taxation, minimal services and draconian movement controls. indeed, asleigh gardnernoted, racially segregated colonial systems restricted the rights of africans so severely that the expatriate somali community in colonial kenya lobbied to be recognized as asians in order to improve their rights!in other settler colonial contexts, the disturbing legacies of settler colonial institutions have been highlighted in recent films on the degradation and wanton killing of north american native populations inkillers of the flower moon, or the infamous 1921tulsa race massacre, both of which were erased from history for decades, and used laws and institutions to punish rather than protect the property rights of successful non-white populations in the united states. the underlying message of these incidents, and of thandika s work on settler colonialism in africa, is not only about the injustices perpetrated in the past, but about the ways in which settler colonialism embeds injustice within the institutions of society in ways that feel modern and efficient to the descendants of settlers, while subjecting indigenous and racialized populations to embedded and enduring structural violence.settler colonialism in contemporary timesin addition to raising questions about whose interests are served by the institutions of settler colonialism, thandika s work emphasizes the ongoing injustices perpetrated by settler colonial regimes. some argue that we can t judge the past by the norms of the present, but it s worth remembering that south africa maintained settler colonial institutions into the early 1990s. indeed, the recent war on gaza has brought the realities of settler colonialism into the present day. settler colonialism is not about legacies of 500 years ago, or even 100 years ago, but is playing out in the televised and techno-military glare of the 21stcentury.in the context of israel/palestine, it is clear that there is more at stake than political inequality. in his recent book,neither settler nor native, mahmoud mamdani, long-time friend and colleague of thandika, noted that the nature of settler colonialism varies depending on whether settlers want the labour or just the land of indigenous populations. unlike in southern africa where the settlers needed african labour, in palestine mamdani highlights a more violent form of settler colonialism in which the settlers only want the land. far from being inclusive, settler institutions focus on making palestinian lives unlivable through legal apartheid, discriminatory taxes, derisory services, and intensifying constraints on mobility, hemming palestinians into a  state of exception , without citizenship rights, property rights, or even a right to life, as repeatedly documented byhuman rightsorganizations, theun, andisraeliaswell as otherhistorians.but, as hanieh, knox and ziadah show in their illuminatingnew book, settler colonialism is not just about the harm done on the ground by settlers, but also about the overseas metropoles supporting the settler project, enriching themselves from the resources and geopolitical advantage afforded by their settler strongmen. while thandika showed how settler colonialism is experienced by local populations, the local institutional carnage and ongoing institutional violence and inequality it produces, the contemporary reality of settler colonialism also reveals how it corrodes the liberal international order, ravaging international law, criminalizing public protest, and eroding moral boundaries not only on the ground, but in theusa, the uk and many other european countries. confronted by the expanding institutional devastation of settler colonialism, past and present, the argument of ajr that it produces  good institutions  is increasingly untenable, and reminds us ever more starkly of the need for a more decolonized institutional understanding of contemporary development.the views expressed in this post are those of the authors and in no way reflect those of the international development lse blog or the london

    "text": "thai foreign affairs minister sihasak phuangketkeow said thailand was  interested in dealing with the issues and trying to find solutions , and welcomed the us playing  any constructive role . - photo: stsingapore: bangkok is open to the united states playing a constructive role in peace talks between thailand and cambodia, but hopes that us president donald trump will not favour the cambodians just because they had nominated him for the nobel peace prize.in an exclusive interview with the straits times on wednesday (oct 22), visiting thai foreign affairs minister sihasak phuangketkeow said if the discussions go well, a joint declaration will be signed at the 47th asean summit in kuala lumpur by the thai and cambodian prime ministers this weekend. the document is expected to cover the removal of weapons and land mines at the two countries  shared border, among other things, he noted.on trump s role in the thai-cambodian peace process, sihasak said thailand was  interested in dealing with the issues and trying to find solutions , and welcomed the us playing  any constructive role .asked if bangkok was worried that trump might tilt towards the cambodians given that they had nominated him for the nobel peace prize, sihasak said he hoped that this would not be the case. because i think if president trump would like to be a man of peace, he would have to work towards real peace, and not just a piece of document. that has been our position,  he said during the interview at the shangri-la hotel.the planned joint declaration comes after the leaders of cambodia and thailand agreed on july 28 to an unconditional ceasefire, after both countries had their worst clash in over a decade earlier that month over a five-day border dispute that led to at least 43 deaths and some 300,000 people displaced on both sides.cambodia, adopting the  flattery diplomacy  approach, had formally nominated trump for the nobel peace prize in august, after the us leader had applied pressure on both sides to come to a truce, using tariffs as a bargaining tool.giving an update on talks between the two countries, sihasak noted that the thais have had a few rounds of discussions with the cambodians.he added that  the most serious discussions we ve had were in kuala lumpur, which were facilitated by malaysia as (asean) chair , and  the us, who wants to see peace, because that s the goal of president trump . i want to emphasize that even though we ve met in this four-party format, it s basically been a bilateral discussion between thailand and cambodia, and we ve always emphasised that between neighbouring countries, we could resolve any issues bilaterally,  he added.the longstanding border dispute between the two south-east asian countries, which previously erupted in 2011, stems from disagreements over the interpretation of colonial-era maps. the most recent round of tensions was sparked by a brief skirmish that resulted in a cambodian soldier being shot dead on may 28.thailand has long favoured direct bilateral negotiations with cambodia, while cambodia has chosen to pursue international arbitration via the international court of justice in the hague.sihasak, a career diplomat who had previously served as president of the united nations human rights council in geneva, said he hoped to boost thailand s presence in global diplomacy, acknowledging that the country s political instability had hampered its foreign policy.the 67-year-old has been foreign minister for just over a month after being appointed by anutin charnvirakul, who was elected prime minister by the thai parliament on sept 5.this came after a thai court permanently disqualified his predecessor paetongtarn shinawatra after she was suspended for ethical misconduct in handling a border clash with cambodia.sihasak said he had asked his friends in singapore about thai foreign policy, and they told him that  thailand s foreign policy has been domestically focused and somehow we ve been mia, or missing in action, in so much as asean is concerned .but thailand has traditionally been one of the key players in asean and was one of the 10-member regional grouping s founders, he noted.the country has its own brand of diplomacy, he added, which is about helping to build bridges, find solutions, offering pragmatic ideas, and trying to find common ground. i want to see thailand back on the world stage not because of the aspiration of being on the world stage, but i think recognising the fact that we can make a difference, and we want to make a difference,  he said.he named cambodia and myanmar as among his priorities as foreign minister.myanmar has been in turmoil since its military staged a coup against the elected government in february 2021.asean drew up a five-point peace plan with the military two months later that called for, among other things, dialogue among all parties, an immediate halt to the violence in myanmar and the appointment of an asean special envoy to facilitate mediation.sihasak noted that the crisis in that country is now in its fourth year, and asean has not been able to do much, with the exception of appointing a special envoy.bangkok supports having a more permanent special envoy, instead of one who is rotated with the changing asean chairmanship each year, he said.the envoy will be someone who has the stature, knows the situation and leaders in myanmar and can advise on the appropriate course of action, he added.he noted that there might be  myanmar fatigue  but added that asean should not give up. he said the grouping should continue to help the country  go down the path of peace and dialogue .another of sihasak s priorities as foreign minister is to help boost thailand s economic diplomacy, and to help the country find new trade and investment opportunities.sihasak, who was in singapore on a two-day introductory visit from oct 21 to 22, had a bilateral meeting with his singapore counterpart vivian balakrishnan on oct 21. the ministers reaffirmed the enduring and multifaceted relations between singapore and thailand, underpinned by regular high-level visits, close defence cooperation, robust economic links, and strong people-to-people ties,  said singapore s ministry of foreign affairs (mfa) in a release.on oct 22, the two ministers jointly officiated the opening ceremony of the 15th singapore-thailand civil service exchange programme, which aims to promote camaraderie and enhance cooperation between the civil services of both countries across a wide range of areas.sihasak also made a courtesy call on prime minister and minister for finance lawrence wong.they  reaffirmed the importance of expanding cooperation in forward-looking areas, especially the digital and green economies, food security, and renewable energy , said mfa.the thai minister described the singapore-thailand relationship, which marks its 60th anniversary in 2025, as one in which  we don t have any problems  and are  constantly trying to find new areas of cooperation .there are plans for anutin to visit singapore in november, he said.anutin, who is from the conservative bhumjaithai party, had come to power in september after forming a pact with the opposition people s party, and promising to call an election within four months.is sihasak concerned that whatever that he manages to accomplish as foreign minister in these few months might be discontinued under a new government? we have to work hard so we can come back,  he said, adding that the short time in office means  not allowing each day to pass by without doing something . there is a good chance we can come back (to power in the next government) if we do things right.  - the straits

    "text": "philippe aghion, one of three recipients of this year's nobel prize for economicthis year s economics nobel prize winners make it clear that the uk s path of high taxation will destroy growth, writes paul ormerodthis year s award for the nobel prize in economics, announced a couple of weeks ago, has not attracted much media attention.but the recipients have a lot to say about thecentral aim of the government s economic policy. namely, how to make the uk more innovative and generate economic growth.joel mokyr, an economic historian at northwestern and tel aviv universities, received his share for  having identified the prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress .the other two recipients, the american peter howitt and the french economist currently based at lse, phillipe aghion, got theirs for  the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction .news updatesstay ahead with our three daily briefings delivering all the key market moves, top business and political stories, and incisive analysis straight to your inbox.although the word  theory  is mentioned in the citations, the work of all three is replete with empirical evidence and examples. there is a lot which can help to steer practical policy on how to generate growth.entrepreneurs hold up the economyaghion and a couple of collaborators published a book,the power of creative destruction, in 2021 which contains many of the key points. there are lots of diagrams, some of them quite technical, but otherwise it is all in english. no maths to deter readers.the essential message is set out in two points which the authors make in the opening chapter.first, innovation and the diffusion of knowledge are at the heart of the growth process. second, that innovation itself relies on incentives.we can usefully expand on these rather terse, condensed statements.a big chunk of total economic growth is generated by young start-up companies which successfully turn a new idea into practice and move into the phase of scaling-up, of becoming much bigger.at one stage, the current big tech companies which dominate the economic landscape were themselves tiny. in a short space of time, well within the living memory of most, they became giants.a heavily cited academic analysis of us census bureau data in the longitudinal business database showed that in a typical year new firms created more than 100 per cent of all the net new jobs in the united states. in other words, the older companies as a whole in net terms saw their employment shrink. the expansion came from new ones.this finding has been reinforced by a project using data based on the underlying us census bureau business register, known as the comprehensive start-up panel (csp).innovation needs incentivesthe study shows show how strikingly important entrepreneurship is for the economy.on average, each annual cohort of start-ups employs a total of 2.6m workers five years later. the authors calculate that without the contribution of start-ups, job creation by all other businesses would be negative in most years.but entrepreneurs need to be incentivised.incentives can be more than simple monetary ones. for example, the regulatory environment around the hiring and firing of workers. existing companies have already made their views known that extending full rights to people on the first day of a job is a deterrent to hiring.aghion discusses in some detail the link between innovation and tax policy, citing a wide range of studies.his conclusion is clear:  excessive taxation can discourage innovation and consequently inhibit growth . whether it is high marginal rates of personal tax or high corporate taxes, the incentive to innovate is reduced.tony blair has recently called for a reduction in the top rate of income tax. along with harold wilson, he is by far the most successful labour leader in the entire history of the party.blair presided over many years of strong economic growth. he understands instinctively, in a way which the current labour leadership appears not to, how a successful and innovative market economy operates. rachel reeves would do well to heed his words.paul ormerod is an honorary professor at the alliance business school at the university of manchester and an economist at volterra partners llp"

ettrump s barynyapresidentdonald trump s shifting stance on ukraine s war with russia has emerged once again. less than a month ago, trump, on his truth social platform, asserted that ukraine s territorial integrity could be restored to its prewar borders if support by the u.s. and its allies remained resolute.in a predictable about-face  and in preparation for the meeting with vladimir putin in budapest, hungary   trump is once again pressuring ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky to cede territory. with territorial reclamation presumably a nonstarter, trump, in another apparent strategic misstep, denied zelensky s request for advanced military weaponry, the tomahawk missile. ukraine s possession of this cutting-edge military technology could have weakened putin s hand at the negotiating table. instead, it increased the odds that his intransigence will continue.advertisementshould the budapest summit end without an agreement being announced (as happened in alaska), look for zelensky to be the scapegoat, not trump s misapplication of leverage.jim paladino,tampa, fla.in my opinionrecently, president donald trump listed some people who had opposed him and said,  they re all guilty as hell.  thankfully, in our judicial system, people are not convicted because of  opinions,  but based on facts and laws. nonetheless, it is disheartening and dangerous for a president to attempt to influence the justice department in deciding whom to prosecute and who is guilty of crimes. would that an independent attorney general stand up to him and not pursue perceived enemies in search of a crime?joe stoutzenberger,erdenheimcommuted sentencelet the word go out. the republican party just destroyed its very last vestige of being the party of law and order and personal responsibility. dead. gone. disappeared. george santos stole, robbed, cheated, and lied about every aspect of his entire existence. people were hurt by him. apparently, his only saving attribute was that, in his ignominious and short congressional career, at least he voted forrepublicans. in the rubble of the former republican party, that is sufficient togain you a commuted sentence. it is no longer a political party; it is a shallow gathering of cult followers who have ceased to be able to exercise independent moral judgment. brian fitzpatrick, for your own sake, i suggest that you leave that cult.tom taft,chalfontrally downplayed below the fold    that is, articles that appeared at the bottom of newspaper pages   is the old expression for suppressing news that upsets the powers that be. placing the well-written report of saturday s massive  no kings  rally on page a4 of the sunday inquirer   and below the dozens of less important articles on the website   is unconscionable. bowing and scraping to maga is complicit with authoritarianism.elizabeth malone,glenside. . .i have been participating in a weekly  no kings  rally for several months. i protest because it makes me feel better. rather than sitting around feeling helpless, it offers me an outlet to express myself and to see that i am not alone in my frustration. saturday s  no kings  rally was an exceptional experience. there was an exhilarating feeling of hope and kindness and warmth. it highlighted for me both who we are and what kind of country we need to be. there was music and laughter and costumes. horns were honking and flags were waving. there were peacekeepers who ensured we did not engage in hate speech or unwarranted behavior. there were a few maga supporters who drove in circles around the crowds and revved their engines, but no one seemed to pay attention to them. it was a good day. it was a reminder that at our core, we are a peaceful, caring nation. i urge anyone who is feeling alone and scared by the current administration to take heart and join a peaceful protest. it is, after all, what makes us a democracy. i only wish the inquirer had put the pictures and the story about the demonstration on its front page. it deserved that attention.kathleen coyne,wallingford. . .i m outraged that the inquirer didn t give more prominence to its coverage of the  no kings protests in philadelphia and around the country. your articles about the demonstrations appeared on pages 4 and 5 of the next day s paper. they should have been on the front page.the inquirer covers daily the trump administration s efforts to eliminate our system of checks and balances, to punish the president s political opponents, to deprive millions of americans of affordable, healthy, and decent lives, to strip citizens of their express constitutional rights, and to send unrestrained and violent u.s.immigrationand customs enforcement agents to so called democratic cities to detain, deport, and terrorize millions of people who have not committed crimes. these are steps right out of the playbook for turning a democracy into an authoritarian state.on saturday, some seven million people around the country, including in philadelphia, took to the streets to protest these actions in perhaps the largest protest in u.s. history. this is an event of singular importance. the coverage of it should be treated as such.sharon weinman,philadelphiaprize worthy?as he attempted to do with the abraham accords, president donald trump (with egypt and qatar) is working tirelessly to bring some peace to the middle east.the unique negotiating team engineered by trump, to encourage an agreement between israel and hamas, appears to be an effective strategy to ensure a monumental achievement.while most of the mainstream media, with their trump derangement syndrome (tds), will resist praising the donald with any accolades, he most assuredly should have received a nobel peace prize if these peace negotiations come to fruition.and, riding on this astonishing accomplishment, he will then exert his newfound influence to achieve a similar peaceful resolution to the ukraine-russia conflict   without sacrificing the lives of american troops.thus, trump will have achieved peaceful negotiations on a scale not achieved since ronald reagan (with the ussr in the 1980s) or dwight d. eisenhower (with north and south korea and the suez canal conflicts in the 1950s).reagan s unyielding tactics laid the groundwork for the dismantling of the soviet union. ike entreated india s prime minister jawaharlal nehru to influence the chinese to support a korean armistice.presidents eisenhower and reagan firmly understood the critical aspects ofthe art of the deal.ron smith,brigantine, ronaldjsmithsr@comcast.net. . .it is ironic that president donald trump thinks he deserves a nobel peace prize for a possible settlement in gaza. although we all want a just peace in that area, it has not happened yet. and the  trump plan  closely follows what some arab nations proposed earlier this year. trump s choice of envoys, developers steve witkoff and jared kushner, causes one to wonder if the quest for peace is so that money can be made off palestinian land. that follows an earlier trump-netanyahu plan for a gaza riviera.trump is not a man of peace.he has threatened to  take  greenland and canada.he has ordered the illegal bombing of boats off venezuela because he claimed they contained drugs. most u.s. drugs do not come from venezuela. trump has intimated he wants regime change there.trump took credit for peace between azerbaijan and  albania.  how involved was he? the countries are azerbaijan and armenia.trump is certainly not a peaceful unifier of the u.s. any american who disagrees with him is an  opponent.  he  hates  his opponents, as he stated at charlie kirk s funeral. he considers americans who demonstrate against government policies  domestic terrorists  and  the enemy within.  trump is sending the national guard to some cities.before people consider a peace prize for president trump, i hope they realize that his actions are based on a desire for vengeance, a quest for power, and his endless grifting.ellen danish,philadelphiajoin the conversation: send letters toletters@inquirer.com. limit length to 150 words and include home address and day and evening

and how can  apolitical  technocrats (whatever they are) really run a territory? to whom will they be answerable? who will police the streets? who will disarm hamas?one can imagine a truly gifted statesman or group of them with huge doses of dedication, time, money and, perhaps, a dash of humility undertaking such a mission on the understanding that this would be the work of years if not decades.instead, we have the leadership of donald trump, who has inserted himself mostly out of lust for glory (read: nobel peace prize), whose time horizon can usually be measured in nanoseconds and who has been known to claim a win long before the game is over.trump did join israel s bombing of iran s nuclear sites and insisted that the nuclear program was  obliterated,  a finding that intelligence assessments did not support.asked the classic, even cliched question about the conflict, trump s off-the-cuff response was,  we re talking about rebuilding gaza. i m not talking about single state or double state.   at some point, i ll decide what i think is right. he may do just that, or he may be off on another tear about something else. the ceasefire and hostage release should be celebrated, but it would be folly to expect much more.newslettertoday's breaking news and more in your inboxemail(required)i'm interested in (please check all that apply)(required)daily newsletterbreaking newsobituariesare you a paying subscriber to the newspaper?(required)yesnoother commentariesdemocrats are stuck on repeatwhat do you do when voters have rejected your party s policies and the losers have nothing new to ...ceasefire and peace are not the samehouse speaker mike johnson, a quick study in the art of laying it on thick, announced that he was teaming up with ...gopher tortoises, ecosystem intertwineda rescued gopher tortoise arrived at the nokuse nature preserve in florida s panhandle while my sister erica and ...experience, age are not the samedemocrat janet mills, governor of maine, is running against susan collins, the state s republican senator since ...ending the scourge of gerrymanderinga consequential off-year election is weeks away and our mailboxes are stuffed with political flyers. one, from a ...people with autism need understandingi am an autistic adult who also has adhd and i would like to say something about the remarks that our president has ..."

    "text": "the nobel peace prize is one of the six awards given each year to the world s most elite human rights leaders. recommending donald trump for the most prestigious prize is like nominating a family patriarch from the godfather for a humanitarian award. that s exactly what israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has done.trump s nomination is not an isolated incident. since the first award in 1901, the selection process at times has been marred by accusations of sexism, racism and the award committee being eurocentric. from kissinger to yasser arafat, the committee had made some controversial picks, engendering criticism and controversy.after his death in 1896, the will of swedish explosive manufacturer alfred nobel established the nobel prize awarded for services to humanity in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace. the nobel peace prize was meant to honour those who  had done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations. obama s presidency would be marked by expanded drone warfare, continued military interventions, and the painful recognition that good intentions don t eliminate the moral complexities of power.like rivers poisoned by industrial run-off, the prize has become contaminated by the very forces it was meant to cleanse. the 1973 prize, the most controversial in history, went to north vietnamese communist leader le duc tho and the us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam war ceasefire. two committee members resigned in protest. reasons? kissinger had ordered a massive bombing of hanoi to ramp up pressure at the negotiating table. he was also under fire for backing augusto pinochet s coup in chile against democratically elected president salvador allende. tom lehrer, the american satirical singer, reacted pointedly,  political satire became obsolete when henry kissinger was awarded the nobel peace prize.  the new york times wrote an editorial  nobel prize for war?  kissinger s co-winner, tho, became the only person in history to decline the prize, calling the peace  not yet really established. the 1935 nobel peace prize was retroactively awarded one year later to carl von ossietzky, a pacifist at odds with his own country. carl von, a german journalist, had been imprisoned in a nazi concentration camp for exposing his country s secret rearmament. in norway, the right wing vehemently protested against awarding carl von, maintaining that he was a german prisoner and criminal. adolf hitler banned all germans from receiving any nobel prizes in the future.no award better illustrates the prize s fundamental problems than barack obama s 2009 win. obama was in office less than a fortnight when the deadline passed for nominations. the prize was immature and explicitly aspirational. even obama seemed uncomfortable, acknowledging he didn t deserve to be mentioned alongside past laureates like martin luther king jr.obama s presidency would be marked by expanded drone warfare, continued military interventions, and the painful recognition that good intentions don t eliminate the moral complexities of power. the committee s choice revealed their fundamental confusion about what peace actually means. is it simply the absence of war, or does it require justice and human dignity? as martin luther king jr., one of the prize s most deserving recipients, understood:  true peace is not merely the absence of tension, it is the presence of justice.  the committee s preference for obama s potential over achievement showed their tendency toward diplomatic theatre over the patient work of structural change.the nobel committee consistently overlooks those who embody peace in favour of those who practice it. the committee passed over mohandas gandhi despite five nominations. this omission has been publicly regretted by later members of the committee. when the dalai lama was awarded the peace prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that,  this was in part a tribute to the memory of mahatma gandhi. eleanor roosevelt, as the first lady of the united states, used her platform to advocate for human and civil rights, chaired the un commission on human rights and helped shape the universal declaration of human rights. she was never honoured. v clav havel led czechoslovakia s velvet revolution without a shot being fired, and was ignored. ken saro-wiwa, sari nusseibeh, and corazon aquino-each of them peace-builders who risked everything to transform conflict into dialogue-were all overlooked. these omissions reveal a deeper problem: when you can ignore gandhi and reward kissinger, the prize doesn t just falter-it forfeits its moral compass.netanyahu, himself wanted by the icc under the rome statute for war crimes in gaza, nominated trump-his biggest weapons supplier and the staunchest political backer-for the nobel peace prize. this nomination of donald trump by netanyahu, which he described as the ultimate host gift, came at a time when he needed american support for his own political survival. it reveals a troubling evolution of the prize as diplomatic currency. the nomination itself became a transactional tool, less about recognising genuine peace work than about managing international relationships.trump s public campaigning for the prize-tweeting about his worthiness and comparing his achievements to past winners-represents the very misunderstanding of what the award should represent. true peace work requires the hero s genuine transformation   the death of ego that joseph campbell described as essential to serving others. when leaders start lobbying for moral recognition, they ve already disqualified themselves from deserving it.the nobel peace prize controversies reflect our conflicted relationship with moral leadership. as the theologian reinhold niebuhr wrote,  the sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.  the prize s problems aren t just about poor choices by the norwegian nobel committee; they re about the fundamental tension between our moral aspirations and political reality.real peace isn t achieved through grand gestures or diplomatic theatre, but through the patient, unglamorous work of building justice, equality, and mutual understanding. it s a work that rarely makes headlines and even more rarely receives awards. the nobel peace prize will continue to generate controversy as long as we expect it to reconcile the irreconcilable: the world as it is with the world as it should be. until we grapple honestly with that tension, the prize will remain less as recognition of achievement than a mirror reflecting our own moral contradictions.the writer is a freelance columnist based in lahore."

    "text": "nobel prize vindicates economic nationalism, part iii: when creative destruction failstoday is the third and final part in our series exploring the theories of joel mokyr, philippe aghion, and peter howitt  the winners of the 2025 nobel prize in economics  which explore how innovation drives growth.in monday s breitbart business digest, weexaminedmokyr s research on political fragmentation and sovereignty. yesterday, weexploredhow aghion and howitt s theory of creative destruction reveals why china s ip theft kills innovation. today, we will review aghion s empirical discovery thatoffshoring destroys communities in ways that domestic innovation does not.we ll examine what happened when economists tested those theories against real-world data and discovered a truth thatvalidates what rust belt voters have been saying for decades.not all job destruction is created equal. the effects on communities depend entirely on what s destroying the jobs.offshoring destroys innovation: aghion s later discoverybuilding on the creative destruction framework that won him the nobel prize, philippe aghion later conducted empirical research that revealed a politically explosive finding:not all job destruction leads to the creative benefits the theory predicts.in a 2015 paper with colleagues including angus deaton (himself a 2015 nobel laureate), aghion examinedhow different types of job turnover affect community wellbeing. the findings provide rigorous confirmation of what factory workers have been saying for years.they found thatjob turnover driven by domestic innovationincreases people s well-being. when a new tech startup displaces an old manufacturer, the creative destruction is genuinely creative. new opportunities emerge, displaced workers can find jobs with more productive firms, and communities benefit from higher growth.butjob losses driven by offshoringto china showed the opposite effect. communities experienced lasting welfare losses that persisted even after controlling for unemployment and even with unemployment insurance. the problem wasn t just temporary joblessness. it was thepermanent absence of the new opportunitiesthat normally accompany creative destruction.when a factory closes because a better american company out-competed it, that s progress. when a factory closes and moves to shenzhen, that sdestruction without the creative part.grave stones that bear the names of local shuttered factories sit across the street from the closed newpage paper mill in kimberly, wisconsin, on dec. 11, 2008. (matt ludtke/bloomberg via getty images)why factory workers were rightthis distinction validates what factory workers understood intuitively. the welfare effects of different types of job churn are fundamentally asymmetric.voters in manufacturing regions weren t being irrational or protectionist when theyopposed normalized trade relations with china. they weren t motivated by racial resentment or xenophobia. they were responding to a genuine economic phenomenon that rigorous research now confirms.the economists and journalists whodismissed their concerns as  economic anxiety or worse were simply wrong. the data proves it.the findings also explain why trade adjustment assistance  programs consistently failed. the programs assumed workers just needed retraining and temporary support.but the real problem was structural. when entire industries offshore, the domestic creative destruction mechanism breaks down. there s no new, more productive firm waiting to hire displaced workers.the jobs are simply gone.you can retrain a midwest factory worker; but if there are no jobs in their community, the retraining accomplishes nothing.the absence of employers isn t a skills issue.industrial policy preserves creative destructionhere is the reframing that follows from aghion s research: policies that keep industries domestic aren tprotectionismin the old sense of propping up inefficient industries. they re preserving the conditions for welfare-enhancing creative destruction.when industries stay domestic, competition forces innovation between american firms. productive companies expand while unproductive ones contract. workers can move between domestic employers. the aghion-howitt cycle functions as the model predicts: creative destruction generates growth and rising living standards.when industries offshore to subsidized foreign production, job destruction happens without domestic job creation. workers face permanent displacement. communities experience genuine welfare losses. you get only the destructive part exactly what aghion s empirical research documented.the choiceisn t between free trade and protectionism. it s between maintaining the conditions for domestic creative destruction versus allowing those conditions to be destroyed by offshoring.china doesn t compete on pure efficiency. it subsidizes production, provides below-market land and energy, requires foreign companies to manufacture locally for market access, and engages in systematic ip theft as we discussed yesterday. that snot comparative advantage. that s state-sponsored dumping designed to destroy foreign industrial capacity.trump s tariffs triumphantdonald trump s tariffs correct for china s market distortionsand preserve the domestic competitive environment where creative destruction can function as aghion and howitt s theory predicts it should.the confident predictions that trump s tariffs would cause economic catastrophe proved spectacularly false. economists decided to play half-educated political scientists, predicting massive retaliation, spiraling trade wars, global recession, soaring consumer prices, and collapsing exports.president donald trump delivers remarks at a  liberation day  signing ceremony event for his executive order on tariffs on april 2, 2025, in the white house rose garden. (official white house photo by daniel torok)instead, most countriesreacted to tariffs by offering to negotiate, lower their own trade barriers, and invest in the united states. there has been no global trade collapse, continued u.s. economic growth that has accelerated this year, and prices of consumer goods subject to tariffs are not rising rapidly.the data validated the policy exactly as the aghion framework suggests it should. preserving domestic competition preserves the creative destruction mechanism that drives innovation and wellbeing.a large domestic market with healthy internal competitiongenerates plenty of innovative pressure exactly the kind of dynamic competition that the aghion-howitt framework shows drives innovation and growth.the argument that we need chinese competition to keep american firms innovative is empirically false. we need competition but thatcompetition can and should be domestic, where the creative destruction cycle functions properly and benefits american communities.economic nationalism vindicatedacross three days, we ve explored how this year s nobel prize validates economic nationalism at every level:mokyr s historical research:political fragmentation and sovereignty not centralized harmonization drive innovation. the eu s regulatory unification threatens the very conditions that made europe innovative.aghion-howitt s theoretical model:innovation requires that firms can capture returns from breakthroughs. china s ip theft destroys that mechanism. the model also shows that moderate competition drives innovation, which domestic markets can provide without offshoring.aghion s empirical findings:offshoring destroys communities in ways that domestic innovation does not. the welfare effects are asymmetric. factory workers who opposed the china trade deal were responding rationally to genuine economic harm.the folks who give out the nobel prize in economics likely didn t set out to endorse economic nationalism. but by honoring the work that explains why sovereignty, fair trade, and domestic competition drive prosperity, that s exactly what they did."

    "text": "nobel prize vindicates economic nationalism, part ii: why china s theft kills innovationin monday s breitbart business digest, we examined how joel mokyr s nobel prize-winning research shows that political fragmentation and sovereignty drive innovation. today:philippe aghion and peter howitt s theory of creative destruction and why china s systematic ip theft violates the core conditions their model requires for innovation to flourish.their groundbreaking 1992 model explains with mathematical precision how innovation creates self-perpetuating growth. but it also reveals a devastating vulnerability: the framework depends on innovators capturing returns from their breakthroughs.china s intellectual property theft destroys that mechanism.the theory of creative destructionphilippe aghion and peter howitt s 1992 paper transformed economics by providingthe first rigorous mathematical model of how schumpeter s  creative destruction generates sustained growth.their framework shows how innovation creates a self-perpetuating cycle. entrepreneurs invest in research to create products that make existing ones obsolete. each innovation generates temporary monopoly profits that motivate the next round of innovation. new technologies replace old ones, productivity rises, and living standards improve.this wasn t just abstract theory. aghion and howitt explainedwhy modern economies experience sustained progressover decades rather than temporary booms followed by stagnation, answering one of the most fundamental questions in economics.the model has a crucial requirement: innovators must capture enough value to justify risky and expensive r&d investments.without adequate returns, the innovation cycle breaks down.the inverted-u: why market power mattersaghion and howitt also discoveredan  inverted-u  relationship between competition and innovationthat has profound implications for both antitrust and trade policy.too little competition breeds complacency. monopolists facing no threats simply extract rents from their existing market position. but too much competition also discourages innovation. perfect competition means zero economic profits and zero incentive for costly innovation.the sweet spot is moderate competition where firms feel pressure to innovate to escape their rivals, but canstill earn returns that make innovation worthwhile. firms need temporary market power to recoup their r&d investments.this reveals whyintellectual property protection matters for growth. patents and trade secrets give innovators that temporary market power. without ip protection, firms slide to the right side of the inverted u too much competition, too little ability to capture returns, and innovation collapses.china s ip theft breaks the innovation cyclechina doesn t just occasionally tolerate ip theft it is core to their economic model. theyrequire foreign companies to form joint venturesand transfer technology as the price of market access. they engage in cyber espionage to steal trade secrets. they encourage domestic firms to reverse-engineer foreign innovations.when american firms invest millions in developing new technologiesonly to have china steal the ip and produce knockoffs, the expected returns from innovation collapse. the firm bears all the development risk and cost, but captures only a fraction of the returns.in aghion-howitt terms, china pushes american innovators to the right side of the inverted-u wherecompetition is so intense that innovation becomes economically irrational.the rare earths disasteramerica s rare earths disaster illustrates exactly how this destroys innovation capacity.u.s. companiespioneered rare earth processingtechnologies through expensive r&d. these elements are critical for everything from smartphones to missiles to wind turbines. american firms led the world in both extraction and processing.china then implementeda multi-pronged strategy: subsidize production far below cost, acquire american technical knowledge, drive u.s. producers out of business, and achieve near-monopoly control. then they restricted exports and raised prices.the result wasn t just lost jobs it waslost innovation capacityin a critical technology sector. today, america depends on china for rare earth supplies vital to both commercial products and defense systems. the engineers with expertise retired or moved to other fields. the institutional knowledge disappeared. the supply chains dissolved.this isthe opposite of creative destruction. it s pure destruction of both current production and future innovation capacity.beyond rare earthsthe pattern repeats across industries.solar panels, where american innovations in photovoltaic technology gave way to chinese manufacturing dominance through forced technology transfer.steel, where massive subsidies destroyed productive capacity worldwide.telecommunications, where huawei built capabilities partly through systematic acquisition of western technology.the conventional economic view treated this as normal trade: china has lower costs, comparative advantage dictates that they should produce these goods, and everyone benefits. but this misses what the aghion-howitt model makes clear:you re destroying the innovation cycle itself.when american firms can t capture returns from innovation in a sector, they stop innovating in that sector. once lost, that capacity is extraordinarily difficult to rebuild.the aghion-howitt model provides the reframing:free trade with a country that systematically steals intellectual property isn t free trade. it s a system that transfers innovation costs to one party while allowing the other to capture the benefits.true free trade requires protection of property rights, including intellectual property. when china steals ip, they violate the fundamental prerequisite for mutually beneficial trade.tariffs and restrictions on technology transfer aren t protectionism.they re enforcing the property rights protection that makes innovation possible. without such protection, american firms face an impossible choice: stop innovating in fields where china can copy the technology, or bear all r&d costs while capturing only a fraction of returns.neither sustains the innovation cycle that drives growth.tomorrow: offshoring vs. innovationtomorrow we ll examine aghion s later empirical research showingwhy job losses from offshoring differ fundamentallyfrom job losses due to domestic innovation. but today s argument stands alone.the aghion-howitt theory won the nobel prize for explaining how innovation drives sustained growth. that same theory reveals why trade with china conducted under rules of systematic ip theft destroys the conditions necessary for innovation to flourish.china isn t competing on efficiency. it sfree-riding on american innovationwhile destroying american incentives to innovate. protecting intellectual property isn t protectionism. it s preserving the mechanism that makes innovation possible."

(the economistsphilippe aghionandpeter howittshare the other half of the 2025 prize \"for the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction.\")for mokyr, a crucial reason why britain became the epicenter of the industrial revolution in 1800 has to do with science and technology. true, many societies before britain had seen scientific breakthroughs and technological progress. and sometimes, mokyr finds, that led to some economic growth. however, no society saw its economy catapulted into a kind of sustained escape velocity away from stagnation before.mokyr centers his explanation on why britain was different by highlighting how it embraced science, technology and disruptive change. he puts a lot of emphasis on the role of the enlightenment, or the intellectual awakening in science, philosophy, politics and other realms that swept europe during and around the 18th century. it was a movement that revolutionized intellectual and political life and helped speed up technological progress.but that still doesn't explain why it was specifically britain that became the epicenter of the industrial revolution. other european nations, including especially france, also experienced the enlightenment.mokyr's research suggests that britain was different because, essentially, the brits operationalized the enlightenment in the real economy more than other nations. it wasn't just that scientists, philosophers and other thinkers had big intellectual breakthroughs. in britain, these scientific discoveries and a new way of thinking filtered down to a skilled class of mechanics and entrepreneurs and other \"tweakers and tinkerers\" who put new ideas to practical use in the economy. in this way, \"macro inventions\"   or big, paradigm-shifting scientific discoveries   fed a slew of practical \"micro inventions\" that practitioners used to incrementally reshape the economic machinery of society, boosting productivity and rocketing economic growth to the moon.so, yeah, science and technology are super important for economic growth. but the crucial ingredient, according to mokyr, was that there was also a skilled population of workers and entrepreneurs who were willing and able to put those advances into real use in the economy. mokyr also emphasizes that british political institutions   in particular, its parliament   were more open to the disruptive changes (or \"creative destruction\") these new technologies unleashed, which often challenged the power and prosperity of entrenched interest groups.and here is where the other nobel winners this year, philippe aghion and peter howitt, help color in more of the picture. they place creative destruction at the center of their popular mathematical model of economic growth.creative destruction is an idea that's associated with the late austrian economist joseph schumpeter. it refers to the healthy process of new technologies, products and businesses replacing outdated ones in a market economy. this process of change involves older businesses shrinking or even dying and, often, workers losing their jobs. so, yeah, there are losers in the process, and, throughout history, elites and interest groups have sought to block creative destruction. but economists, including aghion and howitt, theorize it's a crucial process for economic growth.it's a lot to chew on as the globe grapples with the rise of a new wave of disruptive technologies, including artificial intelligence. but the nobel winners' work suggests that embracing this technological disruption   and finding ways to operationalize these big breakthroughs in the real economy   will be crucial for the hockey stick's blade to keep pushing upward.anyways, we're happy to say that joel mokyr has been a guest onplanet moneybefore. check out our episodes:when luddites attackandimagining a world without oil. mokyr also provided inspiration for a fictional audio drama we made once, long ago called \"the last job.\"and, if this history-of-ideas type story is the kind of reading you're into, may i encourage you toclick here to preorder theplanet moneybook. there's a whole chapter on what causes economic progress and the role of technology, among other things. it gets into more depth than we have space for here. it has some fun visuals, too.planetmoneybook.com. tell a friend.nobel prizesfacebookflipboardemail"

for policies the establishment spent years dismissing: the value of political sovereignty, the dangers of regulatory harmonization, and the critical distinction between innovation-driven change and offshoring-driven destruction.as far as we know, none of these economists would describe themselves as  economic nationalists.  that s still a forbidden stance in most professional economic circles and would spark protests on university campuses in the u.s. and europe. but their workundermines many of the key foundations for globalismand supports the stance of today s nationalists in the u.s., the u.k., and europe.in today sbreitbart business digest, we ll explore mokyr s work and how sovereignty and political fragmentation supports innovation and growth. tomorrow we will look at the work of aghion and howitt.(photo by bedirhan demirel/anadolu via getty images)political fragmentation made the west richmokyr set out to discoverwhy europe became the world s economic powerhouse. what he found is groundbreaking. europe thrived because it was politically fragmented, not despite it.for nearly a century, global governance enthusiasts have assumed thatharmonized rules and centralized authority create prosperity. the european union s entire structure rests on this assumption, so do international regulatory bodies, trade agreements, and the broader project of global economic integration.mokyr s research shows they have it exactly backward.europe s division into dozens of competing statescreated a  market for ideas  where innovators could escape repression. if france s king banned your research, you moved to the netherlands. if the pope condemned your work, you found refuge in protestant territories. heterodox ideas survived because no single authority could suppress them everywhere.compare this to china: technologically advanced, culturally sophisticated, but unified under a single imperial bureaucracy that could quash innovation across the entire empire.china stagnated while europe s economy saw explosive growth.the implications for today s eu are devastating. brussels now imposes continent-wide regulations on everything from ai development to labor markets to financial services.there s no escape valve.if the eu decides your business model violates its rules, you re out of options unless you leave europe entirely.brussels has recreated the chinese imperial modelthat mokyr identifies as the enemy of innovation. no wonder europe s economy has been limping.the latin secret: how cultural unity enabled political diversityhere s the crucial element that makes mokyr s findings even more powerful: europe achieved the ideal combination ofpolitical fragmentation with cultural and intellectual integration.latin served as the common languageof science, philosophy, and learning across all of europe. a scholar in portugal could read the work of a german scientist. an italian inventor could correspond with an english mathematician. the  republic of letters  operated in latin regardless of which prince ruled your territory. this network of intellectuals sharing ideas across borders functioned above and beyond political divisions.this wasn t globalism in the modern sense. it was something better:a shared civilizational heritage from romeand the renaissance that allowed ideas to flow freely while political and regulatory structures remained diverse and competitive.scientists could move between jurisdictions and still communicate. they shared classical education, christian theology (even when fighting over it), roman law concepts, and aristotelian frameworks. but they lived underradically different political systems with different rules, different patrons, and different regulatory approaches.the modern equivalent isn t the eu imposing uniform regulations while allowing physical movement. it s the anglosphere: the united states, united kingdom, canada, australia sharing a common language, legal heritage, and cultural foundations whilemaintaining distinct political systemsand regulatory approaches.english now plays latin s role by enabling idea exchange across borders. but actualsovereignty allows meaningful experimentation. a british ai researcher and an american entrepreneur can collaborate seamlessly while working under completely different regulatory regimes. that s the winning formula.the eu, by contrast, is all political integration with declining cultural confidence. brussels harmonizes regulations while european leaders apologize for western civilization. they veinverted the successful model: political unity with cultural fragmentation instead of cultural unity with political fragmentation.why mobility without diversity is meaninglesshere s the mobility paradox the open-borders crowd never mentions:the ability to move between jurisdictions is worthlessif all jurisdictions have identical rules.the eu promises  freedom of movement.  you can relocate from germany to france without a visa. sounds great, right? but if both countries must follow the same brussels directives on everything from data privacy to employment law to product standards, why would you bother moving?a german ai researcher can t escape gdpr restrictions by moving to france. a french entrepreneur can t avoid eu labor regulations by relocating to italy. the physical borders are open, butthe regulatory borders are closed.this is the opposite of what made historical europe innovative. scholarsshared latin and classical learningbut worked under different princes with different rules. they had easy movement of ideas and people combined with genuine regulatory and political diversity. now you have movement without diversity,freedom without meaningful choice.the united states, by contrast, maintainsgenuine federalism. a tech founder can move from california to texas and face radically different regulatory environments, tax structures, and business climates. americans share language, culture, and constitutional principles, but states compete on policy. that s a feature, not a bug. it maintains competitive pressure and allows experimentation.the enlightenment s secret was that competition is superior to consensus. sovereignty itself is an innovation that fosters growth. europe s laboratories of sovereignty built the modern world."

(naturally, he lost.)2020 economics laureate paul milgrom learned of his win from a knock at his door.paul milgrom, who shared the nobel prize in economics, missed his call altogether after turning off his phone for the night.  even though i knew it was the night of the prize announcement, even though people had been talking to me about it, i said,  i m just going to do what i always do every night,   milgrom told the committee.  i turned off my phone because that s who i am. luckily, his stanford colleague and co-winner,robert wilson, lived nearby and took matters into his own hands.  not only did he wake me up, he rang the doorbell and said,  paul, they re trying to call you from stockholm. you have won the nobel prize,   milgrom said. it was two o clock in the morning, and wilson forgot to mention that they d won the prize together.2021 literature laureate abdulrazak gurnah hung up on the nobel committee.when abdulrazak gurnah, the tanzanian-born british novelist, received the call informing him he had won the 2021 nobel prize in literature, he assumed it was a cold call and initiallyresponded with disbelief.he wasn t fully convinced until he read the announcement on the swedish academy s website.in his conversation with the nobel committee afterward, gurnah admitted he was completely unprepared for the news.  i was just thinking,  i wonder who ll get it.i thought it was a prank, i really did,  he said.in 2016, bob dylan didn t return the nobel committee s calls for days.when bob dylan won the 2016 nobel prize in literature, the committee struggled to reach him for nearly a week. emails went unanswered, calls weren t returned, and even his representatives couldn t immediately confirm he was aware of the news.  i have called and sent emailsto his closest collaborator and received very friendly replies,  one nobel official told reporters at the time.dylan made no public comment for several days, leaving the committee and the press to wonder if he would ever respond. when he finally did, he described the award as amazing, incredible, and said the news had left him  speechless. 2013 physics laureate peter higgs deliberately avoided the spotlight.when peter higgs, the british physicist whose work helped confirm the existence of the higgs boson particle, was awarded the 2013 nobel prize in physics. but the nobel committee couldn t find him. higgs had gone out for a walk in edinburgh, intentionally avoiding his home phone and the barrage of attention he knew might follow.because higgs didn t own a cellphone or use email, there was no way to reach him directly. the committee eventually went ahead with the public announcement, hoping the news would reach him through media reports. when journalists finally tracked him down, higgs said he had only learned of the award after a neighbor congratulated him on the street."

    "text": "prominent left-wing politicians, heads of state, and commentators reacted with vitriol, dismay, and apathy at the news this weekend that anti-socialist opposition leader mar a corina machado had won the 2025 nobel peace prize.machado, a former lawmakerviolentlyejected from her elected position in 2014, has spent much of her career challenging the devastating socialist repression in her country, first under late dictator hugo ch vez and now under his successor nicol s maduro. machado has consistently challenged socialism peacefully, demanding free and fair elections and leading peaceful protests. in her struggle, machado has also endured challenges from power-hungry establishment  opposition  leaders in her country who have ties to the socialist international and have offered no successful challenges to maduro.as a result of a barrage of death threats and gruesome attacks against her, machado is currently hiding in an undisclosed location in venezuela. the norwegian nobel committeeconcededon friday, announcing the prize, that a  serious security situation  may prevent it from properly handing the award to machado.the nobel committeeexplainedin its announcement of the award for machado that she had won it  for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. machado subsequentlydedicatedher award to the venezuelan people and to president donald trump, whom she credited with taking appropriate action to weaken the maduro regime by targeting its cash flows from intercontinental drug trafficking.as a result of her steadfast opposition to communism, and in part irked by her praise for trump, left-wing figures throughout the world condemned the prize going to machado throughout the weekend. among the first to opine, and most viciously opposed, was the former head of the radical leftist podemos party of spain, pablo iglesias, who alsoservedas a longtime host of iranian state television. the truth is that to give the nobel peace prize to corina machado [sic] who has spent years trying to stage a coup d  tat in her country, they could have just given it to trump directly or even to adolf hitler posthumously,  iglesias wrote on the social media site twitter.  next year [russian dictator vladimir] putin and [ukrainian president] volodymyr zelensky can share it. in the pages of its official newspaper,granma, the communist party of cubadescribedthe award as a  slap in the face.  a radical right-wing and violence-inciting opposition figure, mar a corina machado, whose greatest virtue is calling to disorder, instability, and chaos in venezuela, was awarded the nobel peace prize 2025, granma s writersseethed. the politicization, partialization, and discrediting of the norwegian nobel committee has reached unsuspected limits,  figurehead  president  of cuba miguel d az-canel complained online. we firmly reject this political maneuver that intends to single out venezuela,  the dictator added, calling the award  shameful. colombian president gustavo petro, a former member of the m19 marxist guerrilla group andsupporterof the venezuelan regime, published an incoherent screed addressing machado s prize on twitter on saturday, apparently condemning her for having sent a letter to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in 2018. petro reproduced the letter, which was also addressed to argentine then-president mauricio macri and explained, accurately and in detail, the nefarious relationship between the venezuelan socialist regime and islamist iran, which poses a constant threat to neighboring israel and was responsible for the deadliest terrorist attack in argentine history.in his rant, petro compared netanyahu to adolf hitler, a common epithet from the colombian president. why do you solicit help from a criminal against humanity, with an international order of capture, to bring democracy to venezuela?  petro wrote, referring to the controversial and poorly supported international criminal court (icc) arrest warrant for netanyahu.  what does it mean that you seek supported [sic] the only latin american president who supported genocide and the genocidal actor? elsewhere in the extensive letter, petro complained that his visa allowing entry into the united states was recentlycanceled, a result of himyellinginto a megaphone on the street in new york city that the u.s. military should stop obeying president trump. petro also added an aside discussing victims of the trans-atlantic slave trade choosing to jump overboard and drown in the atlantic ocean rather than arrive in america as slaves. however, he did not make a clear connection between the trans-atlantic slave trade and his primary condemnation of machado for sending a letter to netanyahu seven years ago.in the united states, radical marxist activists decried the celebration of a peaceful anti-socialist figure who has, as polls have indicated for years, united the country behind her leadership against a regime notorious for extensivetortureand killing ofchildren.code pink, a leftist movement that has been loudly supportive of maduro,publisheda statement claiming the nobel committee  lost every ounce of credibility.  notably, the prize has previously been given to ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed, who has since been accused ofgenocide, and the world food programme (wfp),implicatedin multiple sexual assault and rape scandals. yet machado s recognition distinctly outraged code pink. machado s politics are steeped in violence. she has called for foreign intervention, even appealing directly to benjamin netanyahu,  code pinkrailed, echoing petro,  the architect of gaza s annihilation, to help  liberate  venezuela with bombs under the banner of  freedom.  the council on american-islamic relations (cair), an alleged muslim rights advocacy group that has been declaredaterrorist organizationby the united arab emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as anunindicted co-conspiratorin a hamas-funding operation, alsoweighed innegatively on the award, referring to machado as a  supporter of anti-muslim fascism.  we strongly disagree with the nobel prize committee s decision to award this year s peace prize to mar a corina machado, a supporter of israel s racist likud party,  cair said in a statement,  who earlier this year delivered remarks at a conference of european fascists, including geert wilders and marine le pen, which openly called for a new reconquista, referencing the ethnic cleansing of spanish muslims and jews in the 1500s. the organization instead suggested the award should go to  one of the students, journalists, activists, medical professionals who have risked their careers and even their lives to oppose the crime of our time: the genocide in gaza. outside of the vocal condemnations, many observers of latin american politics highlighted the silence from other left-wing leaders in the region, most notably mexican president claudia sheinbaum, who said she had  no comment  when directly asked about the award. brazilian president luiz in cio lula da silva, once a close friend of hugo ch vez s who isrumoredto have blocked venezuela from entering the anti-american brics bloc out of personal distaste for maduro, has also not commented at press time. lula had previouslymockedmachado after maduro banned her from running for office.follow frances martel onfacebookandtwitter."

with npr's weekend edition sunday that her country is in chaos and called for the removal of venezuela's authoritarian president nicol s maduro.speaking while still in hiding within venezuela's borders, the right-wing leader decried maduro as an illegitimate strongman who had elbowed his way intoa third termdespite consistent evidence that his administration had rigged the vote.\"i want to be very clear with this: regime change was already mandated by the venezuelan people on july 28, 2024,\" machado said during an interview with npr's ayesha rascoe on saturday, citing last year's controversial, closely watched election.\"the narrative of the regime right now is that if maduro goes, chaos will come to venezuela. that's absolutely false,\" she said. \"venezuela is in profound, total chaos right now.\"machado   whom maduro's regime had barred from running in the race   had backed opposition candidate edmundo gonz lez in the race to steer venezuela as it suffers through apolitical and economic crisisthat has forcedmore than one-fifthof its residents to flee the country.machado has been one of the staunchest critics of the powerful united socialist party of venezuela (psuv) since it first came to power in the late 1990s. a former legislator in the venezuelan national assembly, machado has been shot at, targeted by federal prosecutors, banned from running for office, and forced into hiding by the government of maduro, who succeeded psuv founder hugo ch vez in 2013.\"we won by a landslide in the presidential election, and we proved it with over 85% of the original tally sheets. the whole world knows that. even maduro's allies know that he was defeated,\" machado said.several latin american countries, alongside the united states, agree that maduromanipulated the electoral systemin order to maintain his grip on venezuela's government. the country has been riddled with corruption and,under maduro's leadership, seen the country descend into economic collapse and a crackdown on free speech.the trump administration hasaccused maduro of leading a drug carteland has ordered deadly strikes on boats it says were carrying drugs. the u.s. state department is offering a reward ofup to $50 millionfor information that would lead to maduro's arrest.machado echoed those claims that maduro is operating as a cartel head and blamed him for the boat strikes and broader international hostility towards venezuela.\"[the cartel] are destabilizing, intentionally, the region and undermining the institutions in the united states, because they have turned venezuela into the safe haven of the enemies of the united states   iran, china, russia, hezbollah, hamas, and others,\" she said.\"so, this is a war that was declared by maduro, not us.\"when asked if she would support u.s. military invasion of venezuela to see maduro deposed, machado declined to speculate on whether president trump would authorize such actions, but she called trump a valuable ally in recognizing the \"threat\" maduro presents as a leader.\"you cannot have peace without freedom, and you cannot have freedom without strength,\" machado said.\"when you are facing a criminal structure, they have used violence, all the resources of the venezuelan people against innocent people. people that are in prison right now that are tortured, persecuted and killed,\" she said. \"we need to stop this because it is a matter of saving lives and the regime has to understand that impunity is over.\"machado haddedicatedher nobel peace prize to trump, whom she has supported and called on directly to help steer venezuela towards democracy.when asked whether she did so in the hopes that it would inspire trump to help force maduro out, machado said: \"i dedicated it to the people of venezuela and president trump because i think it's the correct thing to do.\"\"i think it is fair, not only for what he has been doing in the last months to solve long and painful conflicts around the world, but precisely for what he's doing right now for the americas,\" she said, adding that, if and when maduro is ousted, she hoped to see the fall of other repressive regimes in cuba and nicaragua as well.clarificationoct. 15, 2025this story has been updated to better describe venezuelan opposition leader mar a corina machado's political leanings.venezuelavenezuela politicssouth

    "text": "mar a corina machado, the 2025 recipient of the nobel peace prize, dedicated her recognition on friday to her venezuelan people and to president donald trump, stating that venezuelans need his support  more than ever. the norwegian nobel committee announced its prize recipient on friday morning oslo time, awarding machado for decades of advocacy against socialism in her native venezuela. while the left-leaning committee did not mentionsocialismat all in its announcement of the award, failing to recognize who is repressing the former venezuelan national assembly member, it did congratulate machado for  her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy. in her first statement following the announcement, machado declared that the venezuelan opposition   now largely cleansed of thesocialist elementsthat undermined her leadership for decades   was  on the threshold of victory.  she noted that this situation was, in part, due to president trump s longstanding support for the opposition and his actions to strip the illegitimate narco-dictatorship of nicol s maduro of its revenue funds and access to aid from its rogue allies, such as china and iran. we are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we count on president trump, the people of the united states, the peoples of latin america, and the democratic nations of the world,  she wrote,  as our principal allies to achieve freedom and democracy.  i dedicate this prize to the suffering people of venezuela and to president trump for his decisive support of our cause!  she added.machado s recognition of trump is notable given the growing number of voices throughout the past year that called for the american president to receive the prize. theleadersof the governments of israel, cambodia, rwanda, pakistan, armenia, azerbaijan, and gabon have all publicly stated they would support trump receiving the prize, recognizing his role in ending conflicts in nagorno-karabakh, the democratic republic of the congo (drc), and gaza. trump also played a role in ending a rapidly escalating conflict between pakistan and india this year, and similarly in thailand and cambodia.machado herself, a center-right leader, has been supportive of trump administration actions to limit the influence and power of the maduro regime. in an appearance on donald trump, jr. s podcasttriggeredin february, machado expressed optimism that the maduro regime would fall soon because, under trump,  there is a very strong new administration that had the correct vision on how to address a criminal structure. of the maduro regime, she emphasized,  this is not a political actor, this is a criminal structure that should be addressed from a law enforcement approach    referring to maduro s close ties to the cartel de los soles, a cocaine-trafficking operation, and the transnational terror gang tren de aragua, which madurounleashedto cause havoc in north america in late 2023. venezuela has been hijacked by a gang that is connected to drug cartels and to the enemies of the united states, such as iran, hezbollah, china, and so on,  machado explained on the program.  maduro has taken over by force even though, as you say, it was a landslide victory, we humiliated the regime under their own extreme unfair conditions. following the interview, president trumpannouncedan anti-drug military campaign in international waters off the shores of venezuela, intercepting shipments of cocaine and other deadly drugs from south america. the operation is particularly tailored to cutting the flow of illicit drugs from operations such as the tren de aragua and cartel de los soles into the united states.maduro hosted a sham presidential  election  in 2024, which he intended to win through dubious vote counts. machado is so popular in the country that, even with rampant cheating, maduro did not allow her to run for president, outlawing her from running for any office due to her support for international sanctions on the regime. machado ultimately supported edmundo gonz lez, an elderly ex-diplomat, as her candidate, and tallies from local voting stations indicate that gonz lez won in a landslide. maduro claimed a victory but never published any statistics of national votes. maduro ultimatelyimposeda $100,000 bounty on gonz lez, prompting him to flee the country.machado remains in venezuela, although deep in hiding for her own safety. she has been the victim of multiple physical assaults by socialist mobs since maduro took power in 2013, including beingattackedwith tear gas while trying to enter her office in the national assembly in 2014 and beingbeatenby a mob with sticks in 2018.conservative leaders around the worldcelebratedmachado s victory on friday, calling her a  well-deserved  laureate and supporting her fight against the maduro regime. the hispanic left, meanwhile, reacted with vitriol. pablo iglesias, a former iranian propaganda televisionhostand formerly the head of the popular marxist spanish political party podemos,mused,  they could have given it directly to trump, or even adolf hitler. follow frances martel onfacebookandtwitter."

stands at the leading edge of a scientific transformation: the fusion of a.i. and biology. a co-developer of alphafold2 the nobel prize-winning breakthrough that cracked one of biology s grand challenges kohl has now turned his focus from understanding life s molecular machinery to authoring it. as co-founder and ceo oflatent labs, he s advancing a vision where biology becomes programmable, and drugs can be designed with the precision and speed of semiconductor engineering. kohl s platform, latentx, achieves laboratory hit rates of 91 to 100 percent for macrocycles an astonishing leap compared to the sub-one-percent success rates of traditional methods. rather than just predicting what nature has created, the system generates what nature could create, simultaneously designing molecular sequences and 3d structures in real time. backed by investors including google sjeff deanandcohere saidan gomez, latent labs is applying these capabilities to areas where conventional discovery has long faltered, like oncology, autoimmune diseases and rare genetic disorders.sign upthank you for signing up!by clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. you can opt out anytime.see all of our newslettersthe promise of generative a.i. in biology is matched by its complexity and responsibility. kohl is pushing back on the assumption that a.i. will make biology  easy,  and argues that the race to create novel biological systems demands new frameworks for safety and governance. from deepmind s london lab to latent labs  san francisco wet lab, kohl s trajectory traces the next frontier in scientific discovery: where the boundary between computation and creation is rapidly dissolving.what s one assumption about a.i. that you think is dead wrong?that a.i. will make biology  easy  overnight. having co-developed alphafold2, i ve seen firsthand how a.i. can solve incredibly complex problems like protein folding. but the assumption that this means we can computationally get perfect drugs at this moment is wrong. biology remains fundamentally messy. a.i. currently amplifies our capabilities at latent labs, we re making biology programmable but it still requires deep scientific intuition to ask the right questions and interpret what the models are telling us.if you had to pick one moment in the last year when you thought  oh shit, this changes everything  about a.i., what was it?it wasn t a single model release over the last few years, but rather when i realized we could move beyond just predicting biological structures to actually designing them from scratch. that s why i left deepmind at the end of 2022 to start latent labs i saw we were at an inflection point where generative a.i. could make biology truly programmable. we re not just understanding nature anymore, we re becoming capable of authoring it with precision.what s something about a.i. development that keeps you up at night that most people aren t talking about?the widening gap between our ability to design biological systems and our ability to predict their broader consequences. we can now generate novel proteins and biological circuits with unprecedented precision, but biological systems are interconnected in ways we re only beginning to understand. as we give researchers and companies these powerful generative tools, we need to develop equally sophisticated frameworks for testing safety, understanding off-target effects and ensuring we re not creating biological complexity we can t control.you co-led deepmind s protein design team on the nobel prize-winning alphafold2 project, and now latentx goes beyond structure prediction to actually design entirely new proteins. what technical breakthroughs enabled this leap from predicting existing structures to creating novel ones, and how does this change the timeline for drug discovery?the breakthrough was moving from predicting what nature has created to generating what it could create but hasn t. alphafold2 understood existing structures, but latent-x co-samples sequence and structure simultaneously designing both molecular sequence and 3d shape in real-time while following atomic-level rules. we re authoring biology, not just predicting it. the impact is dramatic: 91 percent to 100 percent laboratory hit rates versus traditional methods below one percent. scientists achieve in 30 candidates what previously required testing millions, turning months of experiments into seconds of computation.your web-based latentx platform allows researchers to design proteins directly in their browser, making this cutting-edge capability accessible to academic institutions and biotech startups. how are you balancing the need to democratize this technology with ensuring it s used safely and responsibly, especially given the potential dual-use implications?we envision a future where effective therapeutics can be designed entirely in a computer, much like how space missions or semiconductors are designed today. our platform empowers scientists with lab-validated protein binder design at their fingertips, whether they re experts or new to a.i.-powered drug design. in democratizing access to our breakthrough science, we take dual-use implications seriously actively participating in biosafety discussions with regulators and restricting access per international sanctions lists. our integrated approach, validating everything in our san francisco wet lab, means we understand real-world implications, not just computational possibilities. we prove value first while maintaining robust safeguards.you ve achieved state-of-the-art results in lab testing for protein binding and recently raised  47.9 million with backing from notable a.i. leaders like jeff dean and aidan gomez. what specific therapeutic areas are you targeting first, and how do you see competition evolving as more companies enter the ai-driven protein design space?our models are general in nature and are able to generate macrocycles, mini-binders and antibody formats from scratch. we re keen on applications in oncology, autoimmune diseases and rare genetic disorders where traditional discovery struggles. macrocycles are exciting combining biologics  specificity with small molecules  oral deliverability. in head-to-head lab comparisons, we ve exceeded prior work from large tech companies and academic labs. our advantage is integrating our world-leading expertise from experience in building alphafold with wet lab validation and enterprise-grade platform engineering. with the biologics market growing to over  1 trillion by 2033, success depends on delivering lab-validated results, with scalable engineering that satisfies the security requirements of the industry."

possible thanks to us president s leadership, says prime minister during india trade visitstarmer enters parallel universe as red carpet pulled out in india amid trade dealkeir starmer has said the gaza ceasefire deal  would not have happened without president trump s leadership , but stopped short of endorsing the us president for a nobel peace prize.the prime minister said the first phase of the deal would be a  relief to the world  and that the uk had played its own role behind the scenes with the us and with negotiators.speaking on the final day of his trade visit toindia, starmer said the agreement  must now be implemented in full, without delay, and accompanied by the immediate lifting of all restrictions on life-saving humanitarian aid to gaza .but asked if the nobel prize committee should now give trump the coveted prize, starmer suggested that time was needed to know if a longer lasting peace could be achieved. what matters now is to press on and implement this   my focus now is moving this from the stage it s at now   and make a success of this, because that matters to me more than anything else,  he told a press conference in mumbai.starmer has hailed a number of deals sealed during his visit to india   his first time in the country   accompanied by 126 business leaders and cultural leaders. the visit marks the passing of the countries  free trade agreement.no 10 has announced a slew of investments, from fintech to university campuses, as well as the making of three bollywood films in the uk. on thursday, starmer signed a defence deal worth  350m for uk missiles, manufactured in northern ireland, to be used by the indian army. our history together is deep, the human connections between our people are truly special,  starmer said as he left mumbai.  building on our historic trade deal, we are remaking this partnership for our times. starmer has spent time in mumbai studying the indian digital id system, including meeting key figures who designed the widespread system used by more than 1 billion people for benefits, payments and identification.the prime minister hinted that the uk was interested in broadening the scope of digital id beyond making it mandatory to prove rights to work. he suggested the uk would eventually look at linking it to banking and payments systems   on a voluntary basis   as well as for administrative tasks such as mortgage and school applications. it s been taken up on a voluntary basis [in india] in huge numbers, not least because it means that you can access your own money, make payments so much more easily than is available with others,  he said. the speed with which it allows citizens here to access services, particularly financial services, is something that was recognised in our discussions yesterday, and actually afintechdiscussion that we had today as well. so we re looking at those examples of how digital id helps individuals with the processes that sometimes take too long and are too cumbersome and makes them easier for them. starmer acknowledged the government had to make the case for the reforms to the british public, which have plummeted in popularity since starmer announced them. i think now we need to go out and make that case of the huge benefits   and i think that the more people see the benefits that come with this   as has happened in other countries, people say:  that will make my life easier,  and therefore i want to get on with it,  he said.starmer has been welcomed to india with thousands of posters of himself plastered across the main streets and motorways of mumbai. when he appeared on stage at a conference, narendra modi, the indian prime minister, addressed him as his friend and praised him for having unblocked the trade deal.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionstarmer said he had raised a number of difficult topics with the indian premier regarding human rights and relations with russia, though he appeared to have made little headway. starmer confirmed that he and modi discussed how india was continuing to buy russian oil, which is subject to widespread western sanctions. for prime minister modi and myself the focus on ending this conflict and the various steps will be taken to that end,  he said.  and that was a wide range of discussion, but we did set out the steps that we are taking in relation to energy. starmer also said he had raised the case of the british sikh activist jagtar singh johal, from dumbarton, who has been held in an indian jail for nearly eight years without facing full trial. it is often cited as one of the worst examples of injustice among britons still held abroad.but starmer did not suggest much progress had been made.  yes, we did raise the consular cases,  he said.  we always raise them when we have the opportunity to do so. i should say that the foreign secretary is meeting the families in coming weeks, as well as raising it today. the prime minister is widely expected to take a similar trade-focused trip to china in the coming year as part of a mission to ease relations between the uk and china.that relationship is under the spotlight because of the collapse of a chinese spying case, said to have happened because the uk has been unwilling to provide fresh evidence that china is considered a threat.starmer said the uk was keen to pursue other trading relationships but said a trade deal with china was not on the agenda.  that s not on our list, for a trade deal as such, but our position is to cooperate where we can, challenge where we must, and that s been the consistent policy of the government in relation to china. explore more on these topicskeir starmerdonald trumpindiafintechtrade policygazaisraelnewssharereuse this content"

then from letters, words; then from these words, some short sentences; then more sentences that are longer, and in the main very long sentences, for the duration of 35 years. beauty in language. fun in hell. on people discovering his work for the first time, he added:  if there are readers who haven t read my books, i couldn t recommend anything to read to them; instead, i d advise them to go out, sit down somewhere, perhaps by the side of a brook, with nothing to do, nothing to think about, just remaining in silence like stones. they will eventually meet someone who has already read my books. before the announcement, ladbrokes had listed can xue, the avant garde chinese writer, and krasznahorkai asjoint favourites for this year s prize.the nobel prize in literature has been awarded on 117 previous occasions since 1901. recent laureates include annie ernaux, bob dylan, abdulrazak gurnah, louise gl ck, peter handke and olga tokarczuk. last year s recipient was han kang, the south korean author best known for the vegetarian.krasznahorkai will formally receive the medal and diploma in a ceremony in stockholm in december. krasznahorkai reminds us life is difficult, agency almost always out of reach, and the colours of many times and places sombre,  said the poet and writer fiona sampson in response to his win. his work, she says, is  an essential read for these times, not least in a europe once again feeling the squeeze between russia and the us .to explore all books by l szl  krasznahorkai, visitguardianbookshop.com. delivery charges may apply.explore more on these topicsnobel prize in literaturel szl  krasznahorkaiawards and prizesnorwayeuropehungarynewssharereuse this content"

bleakly funny novels often unfold in single sentences, won the nobel prize in literature thursday for his \"compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art.\"the nobel judges praised his \"artistic gaze which is entirely free of illusion, and which sees through the fragility of the social order combined with his unwavering belief in the power of art,\" steve sem-sandberg of the nobel committee said at the announcement.\"l szl  krasznahorkai is a great epic writer in the central european tradition that extends through (franz) kafka to thomas bernhard, and is characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess,\" the nobel judges said.the work that won the nobel prize in literaturezsuzsanna varga, a hungarian literature expert at the university of glasgow, said krasznahorkai's apocalyptic and surreal novels probe the \"utter hopelessness of the condition of human existence,\" while also managing to be \"incredibly funny.\"varga said krasznahorkai's near-endless sentences made his books the \"hotel california\" of literature   once readers get into it, \"you can never leave.\"other books include \"the melancholy of resistance,\" a surreal, disturbing tale set in a small hungarian town, and \"baron wenckheim's homecoming,\" the sprawling saga of a gambling-addicted aristocrat.several works, including his debut, \"satantango,\" and \"the melancholy of resistance\" were turned into films by hungarian director b la tarr.varga suggested readers new to krasznahorkai's work start with \"satantango,\" his debut, which set the tone for what was to follow.\"satan who is dancing a tango   i mean, how surreal can you be?\" she said.krasznahorkai has also written several books inspired by his travels to china and japan, including \"a mountain to the north, a lake to the south, paths to the west, a river to the east,\" published in hungarian in 2003.how krasznahorkai came to winsem-sandberg said that krasznahorkai had been on the nobel radar for some time, \"and he has been writing and creating one outstanding work after another.\" he called his literary output \"almost half a century of pure excellence.\"krasznahorkai, 71, couldn't immediately be reached for his reaction. he didn't speak at the announcement.he was born in the southeastern hungarian city of gyula, near the border with romania, and has since traveled the world. throughout the 1970s, he studied law at universities in szeged and budapest before shifting his focus to literature.krasznahorkai has been a vocal critic of autocratic hungarian prime minister viktor orb n, especially his government's lack of support for ukraine after the russian invasion.but in a post on facebook, orb n was quick to congratulate the writer, saying: \"the pride of hungary, the first nobel prize winner from gyula, l szl  krasznahorkai. congratulations!\"in an interview with swedish newspaper svenska dagbladet earlier this year, krasznahorkai expressed criticism both of orb n's political system and the nationalism present in hungarian society.\"there is no hope left in hungary today and it is not only because of the orb n regime,\" he told the paper. \"the problem is not only political, but also social.\"he also reflected on the fact that he has long been a contender for the nobel prize in literature, saying: \"i don't want to lie. it would be very interesting to get that prize. but i would be very surprised if i got it.\"previous awards for krasznahorkai and the other nobels this yearkrasznahorkai has received many earlier awards, including the 2015 man booker international prize. the booker judges praised his \"extraordinary sentences, sentences of incredible length that go to incredible lengths, their tone switching from solemn to madcap to quizzical to desolate as they go their wayward way.\"he also won the national book award for translated literature in the u.s. in 2019 for \"baron wenckheim's homecoming.\"the american writer and critic susan sontag once described krasznahorkai as the \"contemporary master of the apocalypse.\" he was also friends with american poet and writer allen ginsberg and would regularly stay in ginsberg's apartment while visiting new york city.he's the first winner from hungary since imre kertesz in 2002. he joins an illustrious list of laureates that includes ernest hemingway, toni morrison and kazuo ishiguro.the literature prize has been awarded by the nobel committee of the swedish academy 117 times to a total of 121 winners. last year's prize was won by south korean author han kang for her body of work that the committee said \"confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.\"the literature prize is the fourth to be announced this week, following the 2025 nobels in medicine, physics and chemistry.the winner of the nobel peace prize will be announced on friday. the final nobel, the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences, will be announced on monday.nobel prize award ceremonies are held on dec. 10, the anniversary of alfred nobel's death in 1896. nobel was a wealthy swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite who founded the prizes.each prize carries an award of 11 million swedish kronor (nearly $1.2 million), and the winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and a diploma.sourceassociated

such a group of amateurs,  he wrote in the letter, obtained by this masthead.professor marta krasowska, past-chair of one of the synchrotron s beamline advisory committees, described the potential closures as  a devastating blow to australian science   one that cannot be undone . the potential closure represents irreparable damage to australia s scientific capability and our ability to tackle the challenges that matter most to our future. loadingthe synchrotron is in the middle of a $100 million expansion to add eight new beamlines.federal funding for ansto has been increasing since at least 2016-17, from $312 million to $676 million in this year s budget.the organisation is building a new nuclear medicine facility and nuclear waste-processing facility at lucas heights and expanding the capabilities of several instruments housed there.a spokeswoman for the agency said it was  committed to supporting long-term financial stability. to achieve this, the organisation has proposed changes to its capabilities, instruments, activities and staffing requirements, among other measures .credit:matt golding the outcome will be a stronger and more focused organisation,  she said.ayres  office said he was aware of the cuts.professor michael preuss, president of the australian neutron beam users group, argued in a letter sent to ansto s executive that the beamline facilities were crucial for reaching net zero and supporting other national goals in defence and manufacturing. there s no instrument which deserves to be shut down. they re all performing at a world-class level,

    "text": "translations:  how can a country that blocks the nobel website hope to win a nobel prize? posted bycindy carter|oct 20, 2025the news that two more japanese scientists were awardednobel prizesin the natural sciences has been met with considerableconsternation on the chinese internet.shimon sakaguchi of osaka universityand two american scientists, mary e. brunkow and fred ramsdell, were awardedthe nobel prize for physiology or medicinein recognition of their work in identifying  a key pathway the body uses to keep the immune system in check, calledperipheral immune tolerance.  andkyoto university s susumu kitagawa along with richard robson at the university of melbourne, australia, and omar m. yaghi at the university of california, berkeley were awarded the nobel for chemistry for creating  metal-organic frameworks that can be used to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases or catalyse chemical reactions.  (these tremendously porous  super sponge  materials have beenlikened to  hermione s handbag. )in the last 25 years, japan has produced 22 nobel prize laureates (three are japanese-american), an average of nearly one per year. back in 2002, the japanese government s stated goal of winning 30 nobel prizes over the next 50 years was mocked by chinese state media, including xinhua news agency,as a reckless boast. japan s string of wins stands in contrast to a dearth of chinese laureates in the sciences: china s last nobel science laureate waspharmaceutical chemist tu youyou, awarded the 2015 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for synthesizing artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin, treatments for malaria that saved millions of lives. (china s first nobel laureate,theoretical physicist yang zhenning, or yang chen-ning,passed away in beijingthis weekend at the age of 103, inspiring manyadmiring tributes.)japan s latest nobel prize wins were noticeably downplayed by chinese state media and other outlets, some of which featured vague headlines about the awards being  split between three recipients.  others took a more defensive tone: an article from guancha.com was titled  japan wins nobel prizes, but china is richer and better at poaching talent.  the beijing daily, the official newspaper of the beijing municipal committee of the chinese communist party, published an opinion piece titled,  whether or not we win foreign awards is not indicative of china s progress.  it argued that the nobel prize is overrated and pointed to achievements such as the artificial synthesis of bovine insulin, the development of hybrid rice strains, manned spaceflight, and the  two bombs, one satellite  program as proof of china s scientific prowess. reactions from online nationalists included insistence that the nobel committee discriminates against china, and that xi jinping deserves a nobel prize for raising so many chinese citizens out of poverty.a number of other online commenters were more circumspect, penning essays on such topics aswhether nobel prizes are importantin spurringprogress in science; which aspects of japanese society and academiafoster scientific innovation; and to what extent issues such as widespread censorship, hierarchy in academe, andexcessive materialism and utilitarianismserve to impede chinese scientific progress.one chinese netizen, noting that the officialnobel prize website has long been blocked in china, posed the question,  how can a country that blocks the nobel website hope to win a nobel prize?  several essayistsmocked state media stendency todownplay nobel prizes won by other countries, particularly by japan. chinese social media users dug up past articles to highlight state media s short memory when it comes to nobel coverage, including xinhua s aforementioned skeptical take on japan s nobel ambitions, and a widely quoted 2013 speech by chinese academy of sciences member huang wei declaring that  a decade from now,chinese nobel prize winners will become commonplace. cdt chinese editors have archived seven articles and numerous online comments about the recent nobel prize winners. an article by ni ren at the wechat account black noise,  four reasons why japan is able to win a nobel prize every year,  chalks up japan s success at producing nobel prize winners to four key reasons: a robust educational system that encourages creativity and exploration; relative socioeconomic equality and a society that respects and funds scientists; a culture of patience that supports long-term research projects; and corporate support for basic science and r&d. nobel, schmobel: real success is having work-unit subsidized peanut oil in the trunk of your car,  an article byye kefeifrom the wechat account common sense that used to be nonsense, discusses  the usefulness of the useless  and the drawbacks of utilitarianism. ye argues that the prevalence of an extremely narrow and utilitarian mindset one that equates success with a stable government job and its attendant money, perks, and prestige has stunted individual fulfillment and genuine innovation in china. he also contrasts what he describes as japanese and other overseas universities  tolerance for long-term, curiosity-driven research with chinese universities  focus on quick results, clear applications, and quantifiable metrics. one section of the article discusses how chinese teachers and parents reinforce concepts of hard work and sacrifice, and often discourage their children and students from supposedly  useless  pursuits:everything and every experience in life is divided into \"useful\" and \"useless.\" from an early age, chinese children are told to stay away from  useless  pursuits: what s the point of drawing? it s not like you re ever going to become an artist. what good is reading novels? they re just made-up nonsense that ll lead you astray. why bother playing basketball? you d be better off doing your homework. what use is music? what are you going to do, become a street busker? and forget about playing with building blocks, or playing in the sandbox, or watching cartoons: those are an even bigger waste of time.this utilitarian mindset isn t limited to one s school years: it pervades many people s lives. if something won t help you get promoted, earn more money, get into college, pass the civil-service exam, or land a good job, it gets classified as  useless. as a result, many people find themselves trapped in dull, miserable lives. they can t express their joy or sadness through music because they never learned to play an instrument. when they see beautiful scenery, they can t sketch it. despite a decade or more of schooling, they ve rarely read a book for pleasure. the resulting aesthetic deficiency means that many people have such terrible taste that they can scarcely decorate their homes or put together a decent-looking outfit.many parents fail to grasp a simple truth: when you apply a utilitarian approach to your child s education and focus too much on whether activities are  useful,  you ve already robbed that child of their future.[ ] utilitarian thinking is deeply rooted in chinese society. our system of testing and evaluation is overly homogenized; success is too narrowly defined as advanced education, high income, and high social status; and there is no room for diverse, pluralistic values   to thrive. [chinese]a satirical article from wechat account personal memory bank expresses  the hope that the nobel will return to the  correct path,  and that official media will point the way.  the author uses humor to highlight chinese state media s contradictory attitude toward the nobel prize: portraying it as a vindication of china s system when the winners are chinese citizens (such as tu youyou in 2015), and downplaying its significance when the recipients are japanese or non-chinese scientists or worse, dissidents or ccp critics:it seems that unless it is won by someone chinese, the nobel prize is wrong.but that s not always the case. for example, there are two chinese individuals who won nobel prizes in other categories, which led to years of  error messages  [for chinese attempting to access] the official nobel prize website.[\"two chinese individuals\" likely refers to dissidentliu xiaobo, awarded the nobel peace prize in 2010 while serving an 11-year sentence for \"inciting subversion of state power,\" and the 14th dalai lama, 1989 s nobel peace prize recipient.]to sum up: if the winner was backed by the chinese government, it s the correct decision; if not, it s using the nobel prize to fan anti-china sentiment.[ ] our media is apparently now very worried about the future of japanese scientific research.as early as a decade ago, in 2015, a chinese journal published an article titled  the profound crisis lurking behind japan s stunning nobel prize wins,  fretting that the japanese obsession with nobel prizes had caused them to stray from their ideals and forget what they stood for.that these  palace eunuchs  would fret about the emperor s health is not unreasonable after all, it just demonstrates their profound sense of responsibility for  the fate of all humankind.  [chinese]a second satirical piece,  despite little hope of winning the nobel prize, we re still tackling big challenges,  is from weibo accountjust call me xiong taihang. the author, the former publisher and editor-in-chief of blog weekly magazine, parodies the defensive and  whataboutist  tone of the beijing daily op-ed. while reminding readers that nobel prizes still matter because they recognize novel scientific breakthroughs that might benefit all humankind, the author indulges in some amusing speculation about how ordinary citizens might apply beijing daily-style  whataboutism  in their daily lives:\"whether or not we win foreign awards is not indicative of china s progress\"this [op-ed from the beijing daily] is a powerful manifesto criticizing the nobel prize and laying bare the prize s many shortcomings.pay particular attention to this passage:by breaking free from our nobel-prize obsession and taking an objective look at the past and present, we can see that over the past seven decades, china has accomplished the largest-scale modernization in human history. china s scientific and technological development has always served the pressing demands of national survival and progress. from the  two bombs, one satellite  program to the artificial synthesis of bovine insulin, from hybrid rice to manned space flight, we have notched up a long series of independent breakthroughs in key fields, and established a robust and self-sufficient industrial and r&d infrastructure.this model of applying knowledge and mobilizing resources to tackle major challenges may seem incompatible with winning nobel prizes, but it has undoubtedly provided considerable momentum to china s modernization, helping to bolster fundamental scientific research [ ]what does this mean?it means that although we might not get a nobel prize, we re tackling big challenges and doing great things, and basically kicking ass in other areas.if only we could apply such glib deflection to our daily lives.are you a delivery driver who messed up a take-out order, and the hungry customer called to complain? just whack him in the face with a newspaper op-ed and say:  although my delivery method may seem incompatible with you getting your meal, it s allowed me to deliver more orders in the short term, thus providing considerable momentum to improving our national food distribution industry! are you a prospective college student whose parents are furious because you only scored 280 points on the university entrance exam? just whack them in the face with a newspaper and say:  although my study method may not get me into a top university, now i can focus on bigger things. going to a junior- or vocational college means i can get out into the working world a whole year earlier! are you a member of the chinese national men s soccer team, whose fans are furious because the team is ranked dead last in its division? just whack them in the face with a newspaper and say:  although our style of play might not get us into the world cup, it has helped to bolster the confidence of other asian teams.\"you see? with deflection as your weapon, you just can t lose.

(many estimates of the costs of climate technology fail to take into account the costs of doing nothing.)on us soil, trump has systematically reversed climate and energy policies. funded by the gas and oil industries, trump is driving a doctrine of  energy dominance , aggressively promoting fossil fuel extraction, while sabotaging the growth of renewable energy mandated by former president joe biden. his colleagues are diligent in unpicking hundreds of laws and rules on issues such as energy efficiency or appliance efficiency.he has specifically targeted the wind, solar, and electric vehicle (ev) sectors. federal agencies have delayed or halted approvals for major onshore and offshore wind projects. the administration has sought to cancel or suspend clean energy grants and subsidies, including attempts to dismantle incentives for evs by reversing vehicle emissions standards.open image in galleryusaid funding has been slashed by donald trump(afp/getty)he supported the controversial keystone xl and dakota access pipelines, even though scientists warn that humankind has already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate. he has also opened vast, protected federal lands and waters, including the arctic national wildlife refuge (anwr), to potential aggressive oil and gas leasing.trump s environmental protection agency (epa) replaced the democrats  clean power plan with the far less restrictive affordable clean energy rule. regulations designed to limit potent methane leaks from drilling operations were also rolled back   even though methane is a greenhouse gas more than 20 times more powerful than co2.it was all part of trump s plan to reduce perceived environmental  burdens , ensure energy independence, and cement the nation s status as the world s leading oil and natural gas producer.now, the nobel committee does make some controversial choices   think henry kissinger, barack obama and aung san suu kyi   all derided for various reasons, but in 2007 it bestowed the peace award on al gore and the intergovernmental panel onclimate changein 2007. it would be deeply perverse to pin the same accolade on a man who appears to be at war with the planet, calling climate change action a scam, pathetic, a joke.roger harrabin is an honorary fellow at st catharine s college, cambridge and a former bbc correspondentthis article has been produced as part of the independent srethinking global aidprojectjoin our commenting forumjoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their repliescomments"

a hard blow.the baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pramwhen i came in, and i was embarrassedby old men standing up to shake my handand tell me they were  sorry for my trouble, whispers informed strangers i was the eldest,away at school, as my mother held my handin hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs.at ten o clock the ambulance arrivedwith the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses.next morning i went up into the room. snowdropsand candles soothed the bedside; i saw himfor the first time in six weeks. paler now,wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,he lay in the four-foot box as in his cot.no gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.a four-foot box, a foot for every year. the young seamus heaney wasn t there when it happened. he was away at school. just another mundane evening, christopher and another brother had been sent to the bus stop to give the bus conductor a letter to post in belfast, as was the way in those days; his mother was at home, hanging clothes out on the line; his other two brothers, pat and dan, were walking down the other side of the road, on an errand to fetch paraffin oil.heaney tells dennis o driscoll in the book \"stepping stones\" that he can hardly bear to think about his little brother, just three and a half, noticing his big brothers on the other side of the road and running out from behind the bus to greet them. the driver of the oncoming car hadn t a chance, and within only hours, christopher died at the mid-ulster hospital, in magherafelt.christopher was later buried at st. mary s parish church. in bellaghy, where his big brother, seamus, has been buried too, in the south derry earth from which his father, paddy, famously cut turf:from \"digging\": by god, the old man could handle a spade.just like his old man.my grandfather cut more turf in a daythan any other man on toner s bog.once i carried him milk in a bottlecorked sloppily with paper. he straightened upto drink it, then fell to right awaynicking and slicing neatly, heaving sodsover his shoulder, going down and downfor the good turf. digging. here, seamus heaney reads \"digging:\"read moreseamus heaney's \"hope and history,\" ireland's favorite poet's vision of the worldif you were to ask me to draw a map of my child-world, the one in which i moved before i started school, all heaney s places would be marked on it. i belong to those places too, and they are mine: magherafelt, bellaghy, castledawson, the moyola river, the moss, upperlands, the hillhead, toomebridge, cookstown, the lough shore   and the broagh   where my mother grew up.from  broagh \". . . broagh, its low tattooamong the windyboortreesand rhubarb-bladesended almostsuddenly, like that lastghthe strangers founddifficult to manage. \"one of seven children, my mother was reared on a farm not far from the heaneys. she remembers the man seamus immortalized in  digging,  his father, paddy heaney, in yellow boots and a heavy coat, trading cattle at the local fairs. she remembers seamus as well, riding his bicycle, his face against the wind, his sandy hair flying behind him.as a young mother, she frequently took me  up home  on the bus from antrim to the hillhead and then we would walk the rest of the way along the back road to my grandparent s house. i still remember being scared of what might be hiding in the shadows of sprawling rhododendron bushes and the beech and alder trees that hung over us, but of course, there was nothing to fear.as i grew older and the troubles boiled, indeed there were other things to be afraid of on the road back to antrim. real things, as we wondered silently what lurked behind the questions asked by british soldiers when they stopped my father s car on our way home. dimming our lights for them. answering obediently. waiting for them to release us onto our roads.from: \"the toome road\" one morning early i met armored carsin convoy, warbling along on powerful tires,all camouflaged with broken alder branches,and headphoned soldiers standing up in turrets.how long were they approaching down my roadsas if they owned them? but when i was a little girl, i was oblivious to all of this. i stayed at my grandparents' house in broagh (irish for riverbank, bruach), absorbing the rustic, rhythmic speech of the men cutting turf, digging potatoes or baling hay, and the lovely heartsome sighs of my granny as she carried buckets of water in from the pump in the yard and then made milky tea for the men coming in from the fields, men like big jim evans. forty-five years later, and i can still see her, wiping her elegant hands on a flowery apron, wearing a sunny yellow cardigan and a big indulgent smile for me. how she loved me.\"1. mossbawn sunlight\"there was a sunlit absence.the helmeted pump in the yardheated its iron,water honeyedin the slung bucketand the sun stoodlike a griddle coolingagainst the wallof each long afternoon.so, her hands scuffledover the bakeboard,the reddening stovesent its plaque of heatagainst her where she stoodin a floury apronby the window.now she dusts the boardwith a goose s wing,now sits, broad-lapped,with whitened nailsand measling shins:here is a spaceagain, the scone risingto the tick of two clocks.and here is lovelike a tinsmith s scoopsunk past its gleamin the meal-bin. there were the long walks with my grandfather, down well-trodden broagh byways that were wild with bluebells and foxgloves. on warm days, with my hand in his, he took me to mcgurk s shop for sweets and ice-cream sliders. sometimes we spotted gypsies, or tinkers, as granda called them, setting up camp. i remember thinking they must live charmed lives in a story-book world, with their tents and their colorful clothes and their caravans and ponies. then, as now, i grappled with the idea of always being in-between places.the men were tinsmiths, hence the name, and one of them, mr. sweeney, used to visit my granny. she made him tea and in exchange, he brought hand-made tins for milking. the older i get, i find myself pausing to appreciate hand-made things, such as those my father still turns over in his hands, things i would have too-quickly dismissed all those years ago.from \"fosterling\" that heavy greenness fostered by water john montague at school i loved one picture s heavy greenness -horizons rigged with windmills  arms and sails.the millhouses  still outlines. their in-placenessstill more in place when mirrored in canals.i can t remember not ever having knownthe immanent hydraulics of a landof glar and glit and floods at dailigone.my silting hope. my lowlands of the mind.heaviness of being. and poetrysluggish in the doldrums of what happens.me waiting until i was nearly fiftyto credit marvels. like the tree-clock of tin cansthe tinkers made. so long for air to brighten,time to be dazzled and the heart to lighten. i shared with seamus heaney the phenomenon of being first in the family to go on to university   to go away to school. \"in stepping stones,\" he explains to dennis o driscoll:\"even belfast was far away to me. in those days, i was outside the loop, my family had no familiarity with universities, no sense of the choices that there were, no will to go beyond the known procedures, no confidence, for example, about phoning up the local education authority and seeking clarification about what was possible   no phone, for god s sake.\"university education in belfast was a world away from the broagh and necessitated a kind of verbal dance with his mother, when he returned from it to the family home, full of new knowledge, new words, and new sensitivities. i can almost picture him   in that tight space between elevated and plain derry speech, watching every word he says, weighing its impact before he utters it. my mother and i have danced that very dance, her telling me to this day, \"you know all them things. from \"clearances iv\"\"\"fear of affectation made her affectinadequacy whenever it came topronouncing words  beyond her . bertold brek.she d manage something hampered and askewevery time, as if she might betraythe hampered and inadequate by toowell-adjusted a vocabulary.with more challenge than pride, she d tell me,  youknow all them things.  so i governed my tonguein front of her, a genuinely well-adjusted adequate betrayalof what i knew better. i d naw and ayeand decently relapse into the wronggrammar which kept us allied and at bay.there are other tricky steps to learn as you move through the various dances of northern ireland, but once learned, they stay with you for a lifetime. in \"may the lord in his mercy be kind to belfast,\" based on his interviews with the people who live there, tony parker makes an unsettling but astute observation that those born and brought up in northern ireland have this mutual need to know, right from the start, about a person s background, so they can proceed in the dialogue, in the longer relationship, without saying the wrong thing,  the wrong word.  the schools we attended, our last names, the housing estates where we lived, the way we pronounce an  h  or an  a,  all became clues to help establish  who we are.  derry  or  londonderry?   the troubles,   the struggle, or  the irish question?   ulster  or  the six counties?  i remember the first day of my teaching practice in a rathcoole classroom, when one of the pupils, showing off, asked me if i was a  taig,  a derogatory word for a roman catholic. he thought i was  by the look of me,  but he had his doubts. my surname was protestant, and my first name, yvonne, could have been catholic. how should i answer, knowing where i was and who i was?from \"whatever you say, say nothing\" the famous northern reticence,the tight gag of placeand times: yes, yes. of the  wee six  i singwhere to be saved you only must save faceand whatever you say, you say nothing.smoke-signals are loud-mouthed compared with us:maneuverings to find out name and school,subtle discrimination by addresseswith hardly an exception to the rulethat norman, ken and sidney signalled prodand seamus (call me sean) was sure-fire pape.o land of password, handgrip, wink and nod,of open minds as open as a trap. here, seamus heaney reads \"whatever you say, say nothing:\"artfully, we balance these two worlds, at once straddling the one that made us and that stretching far out in front of us, unknown. far out. with age, i find myself turning inward and back to that first, to the northern ireland that made me and filled me up with questions and doubts.yet, at the same time, on an august evening when i m alone in the car, a phoenix sky a-tremble with gunmetal thunder-heads, i look intentionally homeward to the vast and too-bright spaces of the arizona desert:from \"known world\"\"\"were we not made for summer, shade and coolnessand gazing trough an open door at sunlight?for paradise lost? is that what i was taught?whatever i am made for, i am sad that there will be no new words from seamus heaney to help me get there, that he has gone back to his first place just when i need him most.from \"anahorish\"my  place of clear water, the first hill in the worldwhere springs washed intothe shiny grassand darkened cobblesin the bed of the lane.anahorish, soft gradientof consonant, vowel-meadow,after-image of lampsswung through the yardson winter evenings.with pails

    "text": "trump convinced netanyahu to take a deal. can he keep him onboard?oct 14, 2025share:bygram slattery,alexander cornwellandhumeyra pamuksummaryisrael-hamas deal a major achievement for trump   but hard work remainsnetanyahu likely to face pressure to resume conflict from right flank as time goes onisraeli elections next year could mean more hurdles for lasting peacetrump pressure on netanyahu will be crucial, analysts saywashington, oct 14 (reuters)   u.s. presidentdonald trump, a self-proclaimed peacemaker who has campaigned for a nobel prize, finally got a camera-ready diplomatic victory on monday as world leadersflew to egyptfor the signing of the ceasefire and hostage-releasedealhe brokered between israel and hamas.but if lasting peace is to take root, analysts and diplomats say, trump will have to maintain pressure on the man whose support he ll need in the next phases of his plan: israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu.u.s. presidents from bill clinton to joe biden have found the strong-willed israeli leader difficult to work with, and even trump administration officials have been frustrated by some israeli military strikes they see as undermining u.s. policy.but this month trump managed to push netanyahu into accepting his framework for a broader peace deal while persuading other middle eastern countries to convince hamas to return all the israeli hostages, its key leverage in the war.the work could get harder from here, however.israel and hamas remain sharply divided over many aspects of trump s 20-point plan and, as israel prepares for next year s elections, netanyahu s approach may shift as he attempts to keep his right-wing coalition together. we re entering a political year where everything is related to campaigns, and netanyahu s calculations may flip from caving to pressure to trying to ensure his political survival,  said nimrod goren, the president of mitvim, an israeli foreign policy think tank.the strength of trump speace plan, said the diplomats and analysts, is also its weakness.the document at the heart of the deal leaves much undefined, and neither side actually agreed to the fine print of each term. that vagueness was key to getting both sides to sign on, but it also means some of the most difficult diplomatic work is just beginning.among the potential sticking points of trump s peace plan is an agreement that hamas disarm and play no role in gaza s future administration. while hamas agreed to trump s plan generally, the group s official response made no mention of those specific terms, and hamas leaders have indicated that they do in fact see a role for themselves in governing a post-war gaza. there are any number of ways this could go sideways,  said jon alterman, a middle east expert at washington s center for strategic and international studies and a former state department official. it s hard to remember an international agreement that left so much to be worked out later. the israeli embassy in washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.a senior u.s. official suggested that trump had gained influence with netanyahu in part by strongly supporting israel on other important matters.trump s first administration formally recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel and the disputed golan heights as part of the country, two things long sought by the israeli government. one thing president trump s done with israel   is that he s not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader,  the u.s. official said.  he s basically stood shoulder to shoulder with israel 100%. but because of that, he s been able to help guide them in the right direction. a sterner trumptrump has a mixed record when it comes to applying political pressure on netanyahu.in july, israelbombedthe syrian defense ministry in damascus even as the u.s. had made a point of expanding ties with the new syrian government. the u.s. president gave political cover in gaza to netanyahu for months amidmounting humanitarian concernsamong european and arab allies.but in recent weeks, a sterner trump hasemerged. he forced netanyahu to call the leader of qatar to apologize after a failed bombing raid targeting hamas negotiators in that country in september. ultimately, he muscled netanyahu into signing onto his 20-point plan despite the israeli leader s misgivings.at the moment, said alterman, the middle east expert, trump can likely exert leverage over netanyahu given the u.s. president s significant popularity in israel. trump s greatest leverage is he s much more politically popular in israel than netanyahu,  alterman said,  and he can either support netanyahu s political future or sabotage it. at the speech before the israeli parliament on monday, trump playfully poked at the israeli leader in ways that indicated he did not feel the need to treat netanyahu with special deference. well, see, now you can be a little bit nicer, bibi, because you re not at war anymore,  trump said to laughs.but next year s elections could change netanyahu s political calculations in ways that are difficult to predict.supporters of right-wing politicians itamar ben-gvir and bezalel smotrich could in theory threaten netanyahu s governing coalition if they are sufficiently angered by the decision to halt military operations against hamas.analysts warn that foot-dragging by the palestinian group over disarming could lead right-wing elements of the coalition to pressure netanyahu to resume military operations in gaza, effectively scuttling trump s deal. we are troubled with the fact that hamas still, today, declares it will stay in power in gaza,  simcha rothman, a member of the religious zionism party and of netanyahu s governing coalition, told reuters on monday. we are not happy with any deal that is not total surrender of hamas   we will not accept any partial victory. another issue that could prove an irritant: a provision in the peace plan that admits the possibility of a future palestinian state, which analysts say most israelis would struggle to accept after hamas  cross-border attack of october 7, 2023.dan shapiro, a former u.s. ambassador to israel, said that if government and opposition politicians campaign heavily against the creation of such a state, it could limit the willingness of arab countries to push hamas to fulfill its obligations under trump s deal. that was a very important inclusion to get the support of the arab states to do their part,  shapiro said. if the political discourse is a full-on rejection of a palestinian state for all time, i think that could color the enthusiasm of the arab parties to play the parts that they need to play. share:"

    "text": "northwestern celebrates newly minted nobel prize winner prof. joel mokyr at monday press conferencechristina lin/the daily northwesternjoel mokyr, history and economics professor at northwestern, was awarded the 2025 nobel prize in economic sciences on monday.carlotta angiolillo,features editoroctober 14, 2025early monday morning, economics and history prof. joel mokyr noticed a missed phone call from a +46 dialing code. that missed call originated from a swedish number and was meant to inform him thathe had won halfof the 2025 sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel.in front of a gaggle of news cameras and photographers, mokyr spoke about his accomplishment to over 130 members of the northwestern community monday afternoon in cahn auditorium. around 500 unique viewers tuned into the livestream of the press conference.at nu s celebratory press conference for his achievement, he reflected on his five-decade tenure at nu, discussed the importance of interdisciplinary study and looked ahead to some of humanity s most pressing challenges.gallery 8 photoschristina lin/the daily northwesterneconomics and history prof. joel mokyr was announced as one of three winners of the nobel prize in economic sciences by the royal swedish academy of sciences on monday. mokyr won half of the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel for 2025 for his work demonstrating how technological processes have led to sustained economic growth.mokyr, still digesting the news, said he s  a little bit dazed. he joined nu in 1974 and said he is proud to be a member of the nu economics and history departments because of their commitment to scholarship and intellectual activity.in his speech, mokyr cited economic historians robert fogel and douglass north, who both won the nobel prize in economic sciences in 1993.mokyr said fogel told him that economists  must deal with economic history.  he said economists can learn from economies that no longer exist, such as formal slave markets and feudalism, in the same way that evolutionary biologists use paleontology to learn about extinct species.according to mokyr, north often spoke of technological progress and institutional change, suggesting that institutions are what hold societies back rather than new technologies.mokyr wrapped up his speech by presenting what he sees as two of humanity s biggest challenges: climate change and demographic change. history is not a very good guide here, but it s something that we have to face   even if history itself doesn t give us an answer,  mokyr said.  i strongly urge the world to keep putting efforts and money and resources and incentives to the people who are trying to invent us out of these two crises. mokyr also took questions from the press and audience members. in response to a question on artificial intelligence, he said that he is frequently asked about it but does not consider it a threat to humanity.mokyr s remarks drew several sustained rounds of applause from the audience. his speech was preceded by brief comments from university spokesperson jon yates, interim president henry bienen and weinberg dean adrian randolph. each congratulated mokyr and made statements about his work. at northwestern, we often talk about interdisciplinary work as a cornerstone of our strength, and professor mokyr reflects that strength with research that brings together economics, history, science and technology,  bienen said.champagne flute in hand, randolph led a toast to cap off the event.history professor and department chair kevin boyle, who attended the press conference, said mokyr s win was  insanely exciting.  there are very, very few history departments in the world that have nobel prize winners,  boyle said.  we couldn t be happier, and we couldn t be prouder. fourth-year managerial economics and strategy ph.d. candidate michael giordano said he was  so happy  when he saw the new york times  article on mokyr s win.giordano was mokyr s research assistant from 2020 to 2022 and now works with him as a graduate student. he said the professor frequently goes out of his way to support students.mokyr s speech was  quintessential joel,  giordano said   funny, with  a lot of big words to describe very basic things.  you can t find a more generous or kind person who deserves this, somebody who has reached the pinnacle of his profession while not losing any moral ground,  giordano said.  i think that s rare, and exceptional. this story has been updated

(eileen t. meslar/chicago tribune)byrobert channick|rchannick@chicagotribune.com| chicago tribuneupdated:october 13, 2025 at 6:15 pm cdta northwestern university professor has been awarded the nobel prize in economic sciences for his historical studies on sustained economic growth through technological progress.joel mokyr, who has taught economics and history at northwestern for more than a half century, was lauded by the nobel committee monday for demonstrating how innovations become a  self-generating process,  building upon previous advances to improve standards of living. i study economies in the past and try to figure out what makes them prosper, what makes them do well, how population grows, what kind of relations there are between workers and employers,  mokyr told the tribune.  i use, basically, economics to study history. he shares the award with philippe aghion of coll ge de france and the london school of economics, and peter howitt of brown university, whose work also explored the mechanisms behind innovation and sustained economic growth.mokyr learned of his nobel prize award monday morning while vacationing at his summer home in michigan. he described the news as hitting like a  thunderbolt on a clear day,  prompting a triumphant and quick return to evanston. i was surprised, because like every other academic economist, i had a list of people that were likely to win, and i wasn t on my own list,  mokyr said, while driving back with his wife and dog.an expert on the economic history of europe, mokyr earned a bachelor s degree in economics and history from hebrew university of jerusalem, and his master s and ph.d. in economics from yale.the author of several influential books on the convergence of technology and economic growth throughout history, mokyr has spent his entire teaching career at northwestern. it was my first job, my only job,  mokyr said.  i arrived here in 1974. on the drive from the east coast to evanston, i heard richard nixon had resigned on my car radio. as artificial intelligence and other technologies are poised to rapidly change the way the world does business, the nobel economic sciences committee noted that societies must be open to the  never-ending cycle  of new products and production methods replacing old ones.the work of this year s three nobel prize winners demonstrates the importance of learning from the past, the committee said. the laureates  work shows that economic growth cannot be taken for granted. we must uphold the mechanisms that underly creative destruction, so that we do not fall back into stagnation,  john hassler, chair of the committee for the prize in economic sciences, said in a news release.mokyr s work focused on how societies such as europe after 1600 became  technologically progressive,  as opposed to china and the middle east at the same time, creating a  remarkable  difference in advancement, he said.joel mokyr, right, a northwestern university professor of economics and history, is congratulated by henry bienen, left, interim president of northwestern university, after mokyr was awarded the nobel prize in economics on oct. 13, 2025. (eileen t. meslar/chicago tribune)by studying economic history, moykr s work may show the past is prologue in understanding the road ahead. joel mokyr serves as a brilliant example of the power of interdisciplinary work to better understand our past, present and future,  northwestern provost kathleen hagerty said in a news release.this is the fourth nobel prize awarded to a northwestern faculty member. fraser stoddart won the nobel prize in chemistry in 2016, dale mortensen received it for economics in 2010 and john pople won the chemistry award in 1998.it is just the latest nobel win for achicagoeconomist. last year,james a. robinson, an economist and political scientist at the university of chicago, shared the award with two professors from the massachusetts institute of technology.mokyr was awarded half of the 2025 nobel prize, while aghion and howitt split the other half. the nobel prize in economic sciences includes a cash award of 11 million swedish kronor, or about $1.16 million.reflecting in real time on the award and his lengthy career in academia as he navigated the chicago skyway homeward monday, mokyr remained genuinely humbled by the ultimate recognition of his work. i never thought that what i did was worth a nobel prize   i never seriously considered it,  mokyr said.  i was surprised more than anything else. but as the saying goes, i ll take the money. rchannick@chicagotribune.comoriginally published:october 13, 2025 at 6:14 pm cdtshare this:click to share on facebook (opens in new window)facebookclick to share on bluesky (opens in new window)blueskyclick to share on x (opens in new window)xclick to print (opens in new window)printclick to email a link to a friend (opens in new window)emailrevcontent feed"

pioneering research inquantum physicscoincides with the100th anniversaryof the birth ofquantum mechanics a revolutionary scientific theory that forms the foundation of modern physics.quantum mechanics was originally formulated to explain and predict the perplexing behaviors of atoms, molecules and subatomic particles. it has since paved the way for a wide range of practical applications, includingprecision measurement,laser technology,medical imagingand, probably the most far-reaching of all,semiconductor electronic devicesandcomputer chips.yet numerous aspects of the quantum world have long remained mysterious to scientists and engineers. from an experimental point of view, the tiny scale of microscopic particles poses outstanding challenges for studying the subtle laws of quantum mechanics in laboratory settings.the promises of quantum machinessince the closing decades of the past century, researchers around the world have sought to precisely isolate, control and measure individual physical objects, such as singlephotons and atomic ions, that display quantum behaviors under very specific experimental conditions. these endeavors have given rise to the emerging field of quantum engineering, which aims to utilize the peculiarities of quantum physics for groundbreaking technological innovations.one of the most promising directions isquantum information processing, whose goal is to design and implement machines that can encode, process, transmit and detect information in \"strange\" quantum manners: for instance, an object can be in a superposition of different states at the same time. distant objects can manifestquantum entanglement remote correlations that escape all possible classical interpretation. compared with their conventional electronics predecessors, quantum information machines could have advantages in specific tasks of computation, simulation, cryptography and sensing.the realization of such quantum machines would require experimenters having access to reliable physical components that can be assembled and controlled on the human scale, yet fully obey quantum mechanics. counterintuitive as it might sound, can we break the implicit boundaries of the natural world and bring microscopic physical laws into the macroscopic reality?discover the latest in science, tech, and space with over100,000 subscriberswho

circuitin 1985, the three nobel laureates then working in the same research group at the university of california, berkeley provided anaffirmative answerto the question above. they were studying electrical circuits made ofsuperconductors. superconductivity is a special state of matter famous for conducting electrical currents without resistance, due to underlying quantum mechanical interactions of electrons at low temperatures. for the first time, the trio observed distinct quantum behaviors of a macroscopic physical variable.in a superconductor, two electrons bond together to form acooper pair. these electron pairs condense into a macroscopic state, which can be described by a collective phase variable shared by all its microscopic constituents. in this state, trillions or more electrons effectively behave like a single entity, resembling the mass collections of atoms that form everyday objects like pendulums or billiard balls.to observe the quantum mechanical motion of this macroscopic phase variable, the three scientists fabricated a device called thejosephson junction, which consists of two pieces of superconductors separated by an insulator layer thinner than 1/10,000 of a human hair. they discovered that, at sufficiently low temperatures (below  273 degrees celsius, or  459 degrees fahrenheit), the phase variable difference across the josephson junction shows a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon known asquantum tunneling, where an object may escape a barrier without the need to climb over its summit.furthermore, the team exposed the josephson junction to microwave electromagnetic radiation whose frequency is close to that of wi-fi signals. they measured energy levels of the circuit at discrete, orquantized, values, which are usually present only in microscopic atoms and molecules. the device used in these experiments can thus be referred to as an \"artificial atom\" namely, anelectrical circuitwith atom-like properties, which is at once macroscopic in size, adjustable in design, and quantum mechanical in nature.implications and outlooksthe groundbreaking works by clarke, devoret and martinis have had many profound impacts. on the fundamental level, they suggested thatdistinct quantum phenomena once thought to exist only at the microscopic level can actually manifest at much larger physical scales. in the meantime, the invention ofsuperconducting artificial atomshas opened brand-new avenues toward building useful quantum machines with advanced engineering techniques.based on these discoveries, researchers including these nobel prize recipients and their research groups have made significant achievements in constructing prototypequantum computersusing superconducting quantum circuits in the decades since. the elementary device unit that makes up these information processors is thesuperconducting quantum bit, or \"qubit\" for short. each superconducting qubit is an artificial atom containing one or more josephson junctions. its quantum state can be precisely prepared, manipulated and measured by experimenters. the perfection and integration of superconducting qubits are among the state-of-the-art challenges in quantum information technology.the 2025 nobel prize for physics recognizes original investigations in the intersection of basic and applied sciences. the prize recipients tested profound quantum mechanical hypotheses through clear and rigorous experimentation.from those artificial atoms have emerged the audacious efforts and rapid progress in building practical quantum information machines. the combination of pure intellectual inquiries and engineering advancement has been shaping this interdisciplinary field since its creation.this nobel prize is therefore a tribute to the three inventors of superconducting quantum circuits, whose inquisitive minds, broad visions and adventurous attitudes represent the true scientific spirit and will continue to inspire future generations.provided bythe conversationthis article is republished fromthe conversationunder a creative commons license. read theoriginal article.citation: from artificial atoms to quantum information

from the nih. michael pierce/missouri s&twhen the2025 nobel prize in chemistryhonored omar yaghi the \"father of metal-organic frameworks,\" or mofs along with susumu kitagawa and richard robson, it celebrated more than the creation of a new class of crystalline materials. it recognized a revolution quietly reshaping how scientists capture, store and sense molecules. these mofs could allow for sensor technologies that make workplaces, the environment and human bodies safer.what are mofs, and why do they matter?mofs are made by linking metal ions atoms that carry an electrical charge withorganic molecules, the carbon-based building blocks found in most living things. together they form tiny,sponge-like structures full of microscopic pores. you can imagine them as an atomic-scale scaffold filled with nano-sized rooms, each precisely engineered to host certain molecules like guests.because chemists can mix and match different metals and organic linkers, there are thousands of possible mofs each with unique properties. depending on how they're structured, some have so much internal surface area that a single gram could cover a football field.this sponge-like porosity meaning lots of tiny holes inside lets mofstrap and release gases,store energy-rich fuelslike hydrogen, andcapture harmful pollutants. mofs can use a variety of chemicals in their structure, which lets researchers fine-tune how strongly an mof interacts with specific molecules.these features have already inspired potential uses such ascapturing carbon dioxide from the airto reducegreenhouse gas concentrationsin the atmosphere,pulling clean waterfrom humid air, anddelivering medicines inside the body. over the past decade, the unique properties of mofs have also opened new possibilitiesfor sensing and detection.since 2016,our teamof engineershas been developingmof-based sensorsthat can detect certain gases and vapors in an environment in real time. these materials' unique properties are opening new possibilities for sensing in health, safety and environmental monitoring.from a storage material to a sensing materialwhen an mof takes in gas or liquid molecules, itstiny framework changesever so slightly: it may change in size, how it bends light, or how it conducts electricity, depending on what and how many molecules it absorbs.by connecting mofs to devices that can sense changes in light or electricity, researchers can turn these tiny shifts into measurable signals such as light, frequency or voltage. the signals then reveal what chemical is present and how much of it there is. in simple terms, when molecules enter or leave the mof's pores, they slightly change how light travels through it or how electricity behaves around it, and those changes become the sensor's readable output.our group at missouri university of science and technology has developed several kinds of mof-based sensor platforms. across all these platforms, the core idea is the same: mofs act as selective sponges that temporarily hold certain gas molecules in their tiny cages, and our devices measure the timing and amount of this uptake and release.in one study, we attached a single crystal of a copper-based mof called hkust-1 to the smooth, flat end of a cutoptical fiber the same kind of thin glass strand used to carry internet and phone signals.this crystal-fiber combination worked asa tiny devicethat could measure how light waves interfere with each other. as nearby gas molecules moved into the tiny pores of the mof crystal, the way it bent and reflected light changed slightly. the optical fiber connected to a light source and detector picked up these changes, allowing us to see in real time how many gas molecules the material was taking in.metal-organic frameworks, such as mof-5 shown here, have metal components, organic 'linkers' and a cavity that can allow in gases. credit:tony boehle/wikimedia commons,cc by-saour probes show not just that gas molecules enter the tiny cages of the mof, but also how fast they come and go. by measuring both the amount and the speed of adsorption and release, we can tell which molecules are being taken up and in what proportion, when several are present together. this dynamic view helps us see, in real time, how the material selects one target gas over others. it turns adsorption into a measurable, useful signal for sensing and identification.discover the latest in science, tech, and space with over100,000 subscriberswho rely on phys.org for daily insights. sign up for ourfree newsletterand get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter daily or weekly.subscribein health care, an mof can act like a selective sponge for specific breath molecules that indicate real, measurable diseases. for example, an mof designed to adsorb acetone can capture and concentrate this gas from exhaled breath. acetone levels rise above normal values in people withdiabetic ketoacidosis, allowing the sensor to clearly and quantitatively detect the disease.likewise, an mof that selectively adsorbs ammonia can concentrate this compound from exhaled breath. ammonia levels increase above normal values in people with chronic kidney disease, so the sensor can provide a definite indicator of reduced kidney function. integrating such mofs into sensor hardware would allow for sensitive, noninvasive screening for these two diseases, based on quantifiable breath markers.coating a material in a thin layer of mofs can take hours. but recently,we developeda quick and simple \"droplet-drying\" method that forms a crystal layer of the copper-based mof hkust-1 directly onto the end of an optical fiber in under two minutes. the resulting film, only about 1/20th the width of a human hair, acted as a high-performance gas sensor that detected humidity, ethanol or carbon dioxide in the environment within seconds.we also combined mofs with a hand-held metal device that can sense changes in microwave signals a bit like how a radio antenna picks up invisible waves in the air. when gas molecules entered the mof layer, they slightly changed how the device responded to those waves,allowing it to detect gaseswith remarkable sensitivity.this sensor made for a low-cost, portable device that could tell one kind of gas molecule apart from another, rather than just detecting that some gas is present. it's like having a nose that can tell apples from oranges, not just detect that something smells fruity.our research suggests that mof sensors within compact, energy-efficient devices can pick out specific molecules even when only trace amounts are present in the air. the pores of an mof can be designed to concentrate specific target molecules. all molecules smaller than the window to an mof cage will get into the cage. so, we design the sensors so that the molecules we are interested in sensing will reside in the cages longer. the huge internal surface area created by these pores makes them incredibly responsive. even just a few trapped molecules can trigger a clear signal.these sensors also work at room temperature and our research suggests they are more precise and adaptable than many traditional chemical sensors.toward real-world impactthe main challenges lie in improving mofs' long-term durability and environmental resistance. many frameworksdegrade under humidity or heat, though some research groups are looking intohow to make them more stable.when combined with machine-learning algorithms, these sensors can learn to recognize patterns from several gases at once, rather than detecting just one chemical at a time much like how a human nose can tell different smells apart. this capability could even extend tohuman breath monitoring, where subtle changes in exhaled gasesprovide early cluesto diseases such as diabetes, lung infections or cancer.researchers are working to embed mofs intoflexible films,printed circuits and wireless devices. with these new advances and further research, mofs could bridge chemistry and engineering one day. as the nobel prize recognized, mofs exemplify how design at the molecular scale can help mitigate problems humans face at a global scale.if researchers can scale up this technology and overcome the challenges, networks of fiber-optic and microwave mof sensors could one day monitor industrial plants, pipelines and even human breath for unwanted chemicals to improve safety, efficiency and health.provided bythe conversationthis article is republished fromthe conversationunder a creative commons license. read

    "text": "prof. joel mokyr has been awarded the nobel prize in economics together with two other economists - philippe aghion and peter howitt - for showing how technological progress has led to sustained economic growth.prof. mokyr was born in the netherlands and raised in israel in haifa. after graduating in economics and history from the hebrew university of jerusalem, he received a doctorate from yale university in 1974. since 1994 he has been has a professor of economics and history and the robert h. strotz professor of arts and sciences at northwestern university. he was also the sackler professorial fellow at the eitan berglas school of economics at tel aviv university.the royal swedish academy of sciences said that mokyr used historical sources as one means to uncover the causes of sustained growth becoming the new normal. he claims that one factor necessary for such growth is that society is open to change.mokyr receives the prize for his development of a theory for sustained economic growth. mokyr identified three important requisites for growth: useful knowledge, mechanical competence and institutions conducive to technological progress.interviewed by \"globes\" in 2018, mokyr said that belief in progress is the key to the wealth of all of us. \"most human societies that have ever existed did not believe in progress,\" he said. \"they thought that history moved in circles. ups and downs, ups and downs, and there was no trend toward a better world. this changed only in one place in the world: europe. the muslim world did not believe in progress, the chinese world did not believe in progress, and in india they do not exactly believe in progress. the western world did develop a concept of progress, and the implications are enormous. if you believe in progress, it is clear to you that your generation knows more than generations that have passed. you believe that you are capable of going further than those who came before you. that the ancients may have been wise, but not all the truth is written in the scriptures. not of judaism, not of islam, not of confucianism. we are rewriting the books.\" \"for progress,\" he added, \"there are always losers - and today there are many of them.\"he added, \"i don't think there is anyone who seriously doubts our ability to advance technologically and scientifically, not only at the pace that was in the past but even at an accelerated pace. when you look at what is happening in science, including the ability to manipulate genes, dna, our ability to create new materials, to control different types of energies - it is quite clear that our abilities to control nature and exploit it for our benefit are increasing year by year, at an accelerated pace.\"so far, everything is good. what is worrying, what is frightening, is that there are many doubts about our ability to manage society, and to adopt policies that will exploit our technological capabilities for the benefit of society as a whole. there is a feeling among very broad strata that technological improvements serve a small group, which is getting richer and stronger at the expense of the rest, while the majority of the population does not benefit. it is possible to argue whether this is factually true. what is clear is that there are people who think that way, and the political reaction today, of the rise of nationalist, conservative, xenophobic movements, is a result of the feeling that the new technology serves a small group of people and harms the majority of the population.\"he continued, \"our world has changed so much that you have to be very careful with almost any claim based on history. for example: there has never been a time in history when the number of people over 50 was as high as now. life expectancy, that is, the number of years you could expect to live the day you were born, was less than 40, 150 years ago. of course, that s an average, and there were people who lived long lives, but in large parts of the world, half of the children born never reached adulthood. half! today, infant mortality is practically zero. life expectancy in all industrialized countries is over 80. that s a dramatic change.\"the second dramatic change is that a great many countries, especially in europe, have effectively solved the problem of poverty. if you walk around cities like zurich, dublin or paris, you hardly see poor people. you don t see beggars. in the us it s more complicated  but even in the us the proportion of poor people who don t know if they ll have anything to eat in the evening is very small. and in the past, it wasn't like that.\"mokyr s warningin conclusion (in 2018), mokyr said that he is sure that progress will continue, but not so sure about democracy. \"i was a great optimist not only about our technological capabilities, but also about the ability of modern democracies to become open and liberal states. today i am starting to think that i am right about technologies, and less optimistic about the survival of democracy and open institutions, including globalization.\"i am starting to think that perhaps we should look back and see how democracies that existed in the past actually became extinct and disappeared. not only the democracy that disappeared in the 1920s and 1930s in places like italy, spain and germany, but also the greek democracies in athens and other places that disappeared over time. it is no longer clear whether open institutions and democracy are what is called in economics an 'absorbing state,' meaning that once you get there, you stay there. probably not,\" he warned.published by globes, israel business news -en.globes.co.il- on october 13, 2025.  copyright of globes publisher itonut (1983) ltd., 2025."

for the first time in history, the world has seen sustained economic growth. this has lifted vast numbers of people out of poverty and laid the foundation of our prosperity,  the prize-awarding body said in a statement.economic growth is not guaranteedthe laureates have also shown that such progress cannot be taken for granted. economic stagnation, not growth, has been the norm for most of human

for sustained growth based on technological innovations,  john hassler, member of the nobel committee, said. philippe aghion and peter howitt produced a mathematical model of creative destruction, an endless process in which new and better products replace the old. winner says europe should learn from u.s. and chinaspeaking by phone at the press conference, aghion said he was  still speechless.  i

ways to reconcile competition and industrial policy.  in europe, in the name of competition policy, we became very anti any form of industrial policy. i think we need to evolve on that and find ways to reconcile industrial policy in areas like defense, climate, ai, biotech, where we are very good, we have very good research there,  aghion said.previous winners include krugman and friedmanthe

 reports later confirmed that trump spoke with her by phone, where she reportedly told him he deserved recognition for his support against maduro s regime.this mix of praise and criticism highlights splits even within u.s. politics. machado has strong backing from latino leaders in congress, many of them republicans. back in august 2024, a group of lawmakers including then-senator marco rubio, now trump s secretary of state sent an open letter to the nobel committee. they nominated her, calling her resistance  exemplary  in organizing peaceful pushes for democracy.the letter, signed by rubio and others like rick scott and mike waltz, came amid rising u.s. pressure on venezuela. it praised machado s ability to rally support without violence, at a time when her country faced election disputes and international sanctions.trump s team has kept up the focus on his foreign policy wins. the gaza deal marks a step in ongoing middle east talks, with the president positioning himself as a key mediator. yet the nobel nod to machado shifts attention to latin american issues, where u.s. involvement has grown under trump.for venezuelans,the prizeoffers a boost to opposition morale. machado s movement has faced setbacks, including her disqualification from running in elections by maduro s government. still, she remains a central figure, drawing crowds and international allies.the white house insists trump will press on with his agenda.  president trump will continue securing peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives,  cheung stated. as reactions pour in, the award underscores ongoing debates about what true peacemaking looks like in a divided world.this decision comes at a tense moment for u.s.-venezuela relations. with trump s administration backing opposition forces, machado s win could strengthen calls for change in caracas. observers in latin america watch closely, as shifts there often ripple through the region.trending nowcosta rica s rinc n de la vieja volcano experiences moderate eruptionguanacaste residents woke up to activity from rinc n de la vieja volcano yesterday morning. the volcano produced a moderate phreatic eruption at 6:08 a.m....read moreguatemala backlash grows after escape of imprisoned gang membersthe escape of 20  high-risk  gang members from a prison has sparked a political crisis in guatemala, with criticism of president bernardo ar valo and...read morecosta rica arrests suspects wanted by u.s. for cocaine smugglingauthorities in costa rica arrested four men from the southern part of the country, all wanted by the united states for extradition on charges...read morecosta rica presidential candidate fern ndez reports spy devicelaura fern ndez, the presidential candidate for the pueblo soberano party, revealed on tuesday that she discovered a concealed microphone in her personal office, raising...read morecosta rica monitors caribbean tropical wave with 70% storm chancethose who live along the caribbean coast know all too well how quickly weather can turn in october. right now, the instituto meteorol gico nacional...read morejetblue flash sale: fort lauderdale to liberia flights ends todaythose looking for a deal on airfare and eyeing a trip between florida and costa rica now have a chance to get one with...read moretico timessharefacebooktwitterwhatsappemaillatest news from costa ricacosta rica oij arrests human trafficking ring exploiting minorsoctober 20, 2025costa rica s liberia airport fixes runway issues overnightoctober 20, 2025what camera traps miss chasing jaguars in costa ricaoctober 20, 2025costa rica monitors caribbean tropical wave with 70% storm chanceoctober 20, 2025bolivia elects center-right leader amid crisisoctober 19, 2025how to grow broccoli successfully in costa rica s highlandsoctober 19, 2025costa rica s blue carpet event unites leaders for ocean innovation and tourismoctober 19, 2025"

(ap photo/eric roxfelt)the day the morning was just insanely chaotic,  said barbara chisholm, an administrative analyst at uc irvine who was assistant to rowland the day he was one of three people to win the 1995 nobel prize in chemistry for their work regarding ozone depletion. you ve got to remember, technology wasn t the same,  she added.  the day before dr. rowland won, his internet started working for the first time. news was still spread by word of mouth or by phone. that morning, a wednesday, it was mostly by phone. chisholm s three-line headset was clogged with calls, most from people eager to be sure that rowland was aware that reines, a long-time colleague (and, like rowland, one of two professors who launched science departments when uci opened in 1965) hadwon the 1995 nobel for physics.finally, one of the callers was a top official at uci who got rowland, not chisholm, on the line. like the others, he wanted to tell rowland about reines  award. yeah,  rowland replied, almost casually. i won one, too. a few schools   caltech, mit, columbia and uc berkeley this year   have been connected to multiple nobel winners in the same year. until 1995, uc irvine would have been viewed as a long shot to join that list. winning two different nobels, in the same year, was kind of unheard of, or unimaginable, for uci,  chisholm said.  so it was a really big thing in terms of the school s reputation. i think, outside of this area, a lot of people didn t really know about uci,  she added.  but they did after that. by mid-morning, chisholm said, a few scientists in the chemistry department were tipsy from champagne. and the usually reserved rowland   who didn t drink alcohol   was posing for photos, raising a carton of milk alongside flutes and bottles.for reines, who by the autumn of 1995 appeared to be struggling with cognitive health issues, news of the award apparently sparked a brief rally. he came into the office at the physics department and, according to people who knew him at the time, seemed to be more alert. a few weeks later, at the nobel ceremony in sweden, reines   an enthusiastic baritone who once sang with the light opera troop at los alamos, new mexico, where his work helped to usher in the nuclear age   sang along in a choir with other winners.the workanother thing you should know about nobel prizes: they re usually late.that s by design. science and math and economics and many of the other fields tracked by the nobel committee are busy worlds, with lots of people making lots of discoveries and insights. it can take decades, and context, to know which advances are monumental and which fall into the category of important-but-smaller steps forward.the nobels awarded in 1995 followed that basic premise. the work that eventually meant recognition for rowland and reines had happened decades earlier.reines, who was 77 when he won the nobel, spent much of world war ii working on the manhattan project, which developed the atom bomb at secret labs in los alamos. he then spent about 15 post-war years continuing towork on atomic issues in los alamos, where he studied, among other things, the after-effects of nuclear explosions.during this period, reines and a los alamos co-worker, clyde cowan, started to work on detecting neutrinos, a subatomic particle that had been theorized in the 1930s but, in the mid-1950s, had not been proven to exist.in 1956, after conducting what was known as the cowan-reines neutrino experiment at the savannah river nuclear reactor in south carolina, they published a paper showing how they  observed the electron neutrino,  reines wrote later.the nobel committee echoed that, saying reines  honor was  for the detection of the neutrino. rowland, who was 68 when he won the nobel, first published groundbreaking ozone work in the 1970s.after starting his career working in carbon dating   a process that involves tracking the decay of radioactive isotopes   the former semi-pro baseball player studied radiochemistry, which involves the use of radioactive substances in everything from power to medicine.in the early 1970s, less than a decade after he d launched the chemistry department at uci, rowland started working on atmospheric calculations with mario j. molina, a mexico-born chemical engineer who studied and taught at uc berkeley. in 1974, rowland and molina published a study that theorized how man-made organic compound gases   including chemicals used in everything from air conditioners to asthma inhalers   could be broken down by the sun at higher elevations and, once broken down, could degrade the ozone layer, which protects life on earth from radiation.the basic idea   that a disappearing ozone layer would be bad thing, and man-made stuff was making it happen   caught on. within a couple years, the somewhat inaccurate idea of a growing  hole in the ozone layer,  likely growing over the poles, became cocktail party banter. what sherry and mario had was more of a theory initially, with no measurements. but it was a paper that explained, simply, that this is what could happen, and it was powerful,  said donald j. blake, a distinguished professor of chemistry at uc irvine who studied under rowland and worked with him for decades.by the late 1970s, california and other states were banning the use of the chemicals noted by rowland and molina. if true, and left unattended, what they were saying meant we were releasing gases into the atmosphere that could lead to ozone loss everywhere,  blake added.  that was something everybody could understand. two decades later, the nobel commentary on their 1995 award, which also included dutch-born meteorologist paul j. crutzen, was to the point:  for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone. nobel laureate frederick reines sizes up a bust of himself at uc irvine in this 1997 file photo. the university honored the distinguished career of the renowned scientist by unveiling the bust and renaming a physical sciences building frederick reines hall. reines, who came to uci in 1966, won the nobel prize in physics in 1995 for his research confirming the existence of the neutrino, an abundant but highly elusive subatomic particle. (ap photo/paul kennedy)the legaciesneutrinos, in the early 1950s, were intriguing to many but studied by few. the paper published by reines and cowan in 1956, demonstrating the existence of neutrinos, changed that, kicking off nothing less than a new branch of science.today, there are a few thousand scientists working on neutrino research in places as diverse as the super-kamiokande (super-k) project in japan and the detector located about a mile underground at the sanford underground research facility in south dakota and a 5,000-sensor neutrino observatory on the south pole known as icecube. they re called mysterious particles, yet they re so damn important to the universe,  said hank sobel, an emeritus professor of physics at uci and a former reines graduate student who has spent his career building on the neutrino discovery from 1956 and who has helped lead some of the research in japan and the united states.neutrinos are a lot of things; impossibly small with no electric charge and laughably difficult to detect. they re also somewhat solitary, because they rarely interact with matter. and they re ubiquitous   several billion neutrinos are passing through your body as you read this sentence.but a big reason science is interested in neutrinos is this: they re historical documents.neutrinos are remnants of the big bang, and so-called  relic  neutrinos were created within one second of the big bang and continue to travel through the universe. knowing more about them means knowing more about the biggest mysteries of all existence. for scientists of a certain bent, it s intoxicating stuff. like a lot of basic knowledge, the work in neutrino research has created things that are of use   mri machines and better and better magnets,  sobel said. but, really, studying neutrinos is a way of trying to understand why the universe is as it is,  he added. a big question right now is about dark matter. why is it what it is? what is it? those are things that still compel me. it s hard,  sobel added.  it s hard and it s fun. i m an experimentalist; i still like working with things and building with my hands. that s what this research is about. the echo from rowland s work might be easier to understand.in 1987, eight years before rowland s nobel, countries around the world agreed to form the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, a self-explanatory international treaty that ends the use of the chemicals that eat ozone. it was sparked by research by rowland and others, which eventually proved the theories about ozone depletion and how it might be reversed.according to federal reports and international monitoring, the montreal protocol has indeed reversed ozone degradation. the once-shrinking ozone layer is on track to full recovery within the next century.along with that, according to the nonprofit climate leadership council, a more robust ozone layer has helped reduce skin cancers and other radiation-related illness, with an estimated 3 million people alive today who otherwise would have died if the ozone layer had continued to degrade at the rates tracked in the 1970s and  80s. an improved ozone layer also has blunted some effects of global warming   including the loss of phytoplankton, which have been reduced because of steps launched by the agreement.uci s blake suggests those gains are direct results of the work by rowland and others. he also believes his friend   who he said  autographed a lot of chemistry books after he won the nobel    would be frustrated to see the world react differently to global warming than it did to ozone.but blake argues attitude, as much as science, is rowland s true legacy. i started with him when i was a graduate student. and he told us, all of us,  if you have a chance, at some junction in your career, to work on issues that benefit mankind, i suggest you try,   blake said. that s something i ve always remembered. frederick reines and f. sherwood rowland in 1967. on oct. 11, 1995, sherwood  sherry  rowland and fred reines, professors at uci, won nobel prizes for their work in chemistry and physics.

(ap photo/eric roxfelt)the day the morning was just insanely chaotic,  said barbara chisholm, an administrative analyst at uc irvine who was assistant to rowland the day he was one of three people to win the 1995 nobel prize in chemistry for their work regarding ozone depletion. you ve got to remember, technology wasn t the same,  she added.  the day before dr. rowland won, his internet started working for the first time. news was still spread by word of mouth or by phone. that morning, a wednesday, it was mostly by phone. chisholm s three-line headset was clogged with calls, most from people eager to be sure that rowland was aware that reines, a long-time colleague (and, like rowland, one of two professors who launched science departments when uci opened in 1965) hadwon the 1995 nobel for physics.finally, one of the callers was a top official at uci who got rowland, not chisholm, on the line. like the others, he wanted to tell rowland about reines  award. yeah,  rowland replied, almost casually. i won one, too. a few schools   caltech, mit, columbia and uc berkeley this year   have been connected to multiple nobel winners in the same year. until 1995, uc irvine would have been viewed as a long shot to join that list. winning two different nobels, in the same year, was kind of unheard of, or unimaginable, for uci,  chisholm said.  so it was a really big thing in terms of the school s reputation. i think, outside of this area, a lot of people didn t really know about uci,  she added.  but they did after that. by mid-morning, chisholm said, a few scientists in the chemistry department were tipsy from champagne. and the usually reserved rowland   who didn t drink alcohol   was posing for photos, raising a carton of milk alongside flutes and bottles.for reines, who by the autumn of 1995 appeared to be struggling with cognitive health issues, news of the award apparently sparked a brief rally. he came into the office at the physics department and, according to people who knew him at the time, seemed to be more alert. a few weeks later, at the nobel ceremony in sweden, reines   an enthusiastic baritone who once sang with the light opera troop at los alamos, new mexico, where his work helped to usher in the nuclear age   sang along in a choir with other winners.the workanother thing you should know about nobel prizes: they re usually late.that s by design. science and math and economics and many of the other fields tracked by the nobel committee are busy worlds, with lots of people making lots of discoveries and insights. it can take decades, and context, to know which advances are monumental and which fall into the category of important-but-smaller steps forward.the nobels awarded in 1995 followed that basic premise. the work that eventually meant recognition for rowland and reines had happened decades earlier.reines, who was 77 when he won the nobel, spent much of world war ii working on the manhattan project, which developed the atom bomb at secret labs in los alamos. he then spent about 15 post-war years continuing towork on atomic issues in los alamos, where he studied, among other things, the after-effects of nuclear explosions.during this period, reines and a los alamos co-worker, clyde cowan, started to work on detecting neutrinos, a subatomic particle that had been theorized in the 1930s but, in the mid-1950s, had not been proven to exist.in 1956, after conducting what was known as the cowan-reines neutrino experiment at the savannah river nuclear reactor in south carolina, they published a paper showing how they  observed the electron neutrino,  reines wrote later.the nobel committee echoed that, saying reines  honor was  for the detection of the neutrino. rowland, who was 68 when he won the nobel, first published groundbreaking ozone work in the 1970s.after starting his career working in carbon dating   a process that involves tracking the decay of radioactive isotopes   the former semi-pro baseball player studied radiochemistry, which involves the use of radioactive substances in everything from power to medicine.in the early 1970s, less than a decade after he d launched the chemistry department at uci, rowland started working on atmospheric calculations with mario j. molina, a mexico-born chemical engineer who studied and taught at uc berkeley. in 1974, rowland and molina published a study that theorized how man-made organic compound gases   including chemicals used in everything from air conditioners to asthma inhalers   could be broken down by the sun at higher elevations and, once broken down, could degrade the ozone layer, which protects life on earth from radiation.the basic idea   that a disappearing ozone layer would be bad thing, and man-made stuff was making it happen   caught on. within a couple years, the somewhat inaccurate idea of a growing  hole in the ozone layer,  likely growing over the poles, became cocktail party banter. what sherry and mario had was more of a theory initially, with no measurements. but it was a paper that explained, simply, that this is what could happen, and it was powerful,  said donald j. blake, a distinguished professor of chemistry at uc irvine who studied under rowland and worked with him for decades.by the late 1970s, california and other states were banning the use of the chemicals noted by rowland and molina. if true, and left unattended, what they were saying meant we were releasing gases into the atmosphere that could lead to ozone loss everywhere,  blake added.  that was something

terms of the school s reputation. i think, outside of this area, a lot of people didn t really know about uci,  she added.  but they did after that. by mid-morning, chisholm said, a few scientists in the chemistry department were tipsy from champagne. and the usually reserved rowland   who didn t drink alcohol   was posing for photos, raising a carton of milk alongside flutes and bottles.for

decades, and context, to know which advances are monumental and which fall into the category of important-but-smaller steps forward.the nobels awarded in 1995 followed that basic premise. the work that eventually meant recognition for rowland and reines had happened decades earlier.reines, who was 77 when he won the nobel, spent much of world war ii working on the manhattan project, which developed the atom bomb at secret labs in los alamos. he then spent about 15 post-war years continuing towork on atomic issues in los alamos, where he studied, among other things, the after-effects of nuclear explosions.during this period, reines and a los alamos co-worker, clyde cowan, started to work on detecting neutrinos, a subatomic particle that had been theorized in the 1930s but, in the mid-1950s, had not been proven to exist.in 1956, after conducting what was known as the cowan-reines neutrino experiment at the savannah river nuclear reactor in south carolina, they published a paper showing how they  observed the electron neutrino,  reines wrote later.the nobel committee echoed that, saying reines  honor was  for the detection of the neutrino. rowland, who was 68 when he won the

chemistry department at uci, rowland started working on atmospheric calculations with mario j. molina, a mexico-born chemical engineer who studied and taught at uc berkeley. in 1974, rowland and molina published a study that theorized how man-made organic compound gases   including chemicals used in everything from air conditioners to asthma inhalers   could be broken down by the sun at higher elevations and, once broken down, could degrade the ozone layer, which protects life on earth from radiation.the basic idea   that a disappearing ozone layer would be bad thing, and man-made stuff was making it happen   caught on. within a couple years, the somewhat inaccurate idea of a growing  hole in the ozone layer,  likely growing over the poles, became cocktail party banter. what sherry and mario had was more of a theory initially, with no measurements. but it was a paper that explained, simply, that this is what could happen, and it was powerful,  said donald j. blake, a distinguished professor of chemistry at uc irvine who studied under rowland and worked with him for decades.by the late 1970s, california and other states were banning the use of the chemicals noted by rowland and molina. if true, and left unattended, what they were saying meant we were releasing gases into the atmosphere that could lead to ozone loss everywhere,  blake added.  that was something everybody could understand. two decades later, the nobel commentary on their 1995 award, which also included dutch-born meteorologist paul j. crutzen, was to the point:  for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone. nobel laureate frederick reines sizes up a bust of himself at uc irvine in this 1997 file photo. the university honored the distinguished career of the renowned scientist by unveiling the bust and renaming a physical sciences building frederick reines hall. reines, who came to uci in 1966, won the nobel prize in physics in 1995 for his research confirming the existence of the neutrino, an abundant but highly elusive subatomic particle. (ap photo/paul kennedy)the legaciesneutrinos, in the early 1950s, were intriguing to many but studied by few. the paper published by reines and cowan in 1956, demonstrating the existence of neutrinos, changed that, kicking off nothing less than a new branch of science.today, there are a few thousand scientists working on neutrino research in places as diverse as the super-kamiokande (super-k) project in japan and the detector located about a mile underground at the sanford underground research facility in south dakota and a 5,000-sensor neutrino observatory on the south pole known as icecube. they re called mysterious particles, yet they re so damn important to the universe,  said hank sobel, an emeritus professor of physics at uci and a former reines graduate student who has spent his career building on the neutrino discovery from 1956 and who has helped lead some of the research in japan and the united states.neutrinos are a lot of things; impossibly small with no electric charge and laughably difficult to detect. they re also somewhat solitary, because they rarely interact with matter. and they re ubiquitous   several billion neutrinos are passing through your body as you read this sentence.but a big reason science is interested in neutrinos is this: they re historical documents.neutrinos are remnants of the big bang, and so-called  relic  neutrinos were created within one second of the big bang and continue to travel through the universe. knowing more about them means knowing more about the biggest mysteries of all existence. for scientists of a certain bent, it s intoxicating stuff. like a lot of basic knowledge, the work in neutrino research has created things that are of use   mri machines and better and better magnets,  sobel said. but, really, studying neutrinos is a way of trying to understand why the universe is as it is,  he added. a big question right now is about dark matter. why is it what it is? what is it? those are things that still compel me. it s hard,  sobel added.  it s hard and it s fun. i m an experimentalist; i still like working with things and building with my hands. that s what this research is about. the echo from rowland s work might be easier to understand.in 1987, eight years before rowland s nobel, countries around the world agreed to form the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, a self-explanatory international treaty that ends the use of the chemicals that eat ozone. it was sparked by research by rowland and others, which eventually proved the theories about ozone depletion and how it might be reversed.according to federal reports and international monitoring, the montreal protocol has indeed reversed ozone degradation. the once-shrinking ozone layer is on track to full recovery within the next century.along with that, according to the nonprofit climate leadership council, a more robust ozone layer has helped reduce skin cancers and other radiation-related illness, with an estimated 3 million people alive today who otherwise would have died if the ozone layer had continued to degrade at the rates tracked in the 1970s and  80s. an improved ozone layer also has blunted some effects of global warming   including the loss of phytoplankton, which have been reduced because of steps launched by the agreement.uci s blake suggests those gains are direct results of the work by rowland and others. he also believes his friend   who he said  autographed a lot of chemistry books after he won the nobel    would be frustrated to see the world react differently to global warming than it did to ozone.but blake argues attitude, as much as science, is rowland s true legacy. i started with him when i was a graduate student. and he told us, all of us,  if you have a chance, at some junction in your career, to work on issues that benefit mankind, i suggest you try,   blake said. that s something i ve always remembered. frederick reines and f. sherwood rowland in 1967. on oct. 11, 1995, sherwood  sherry  rowland and fred reines, professors at uci, won nobel prizes for their work in chemistry and physics.

(ap photo/eric roxfelt)the day the morning was just insanely chaotic,  said barbara chisholm, an administrative analyst at uc irvine who was assistant to rowland the day he was one of three people to win the 1995 nobel prize in chemistry for their work regarding ozone depletion. you ve got to remember, technology wasn t the same,  she added.  the day before dr. rowland won, his internet started working for the first time. news was still spread by word of mouth or by phone. that morning, a wednesday, it was mostly by phone. chisholm s three-line headset was clogged with calls, most from people eager to be sure that rowland was aware that reines, a long-time colleague (and, like rowland, one of two professors who launched science departments when uci opened in 1965) hadwon the 1995 nobel for physics.finally, one of the callers was a top official at uci who got rowland, not chisholm, on the line. like the others, he wanted to tell rowland about reines  award. yeah,  rowland replied, almost casually. i won one, too. a few schools   caltech, mit, columbia and uc berkeley this year   have been connected to multiple nobel winners in the same year. until 1995, uc irvine would have been viewed as a long shot to join that list. winning two different nobels, in the same year, was kind of unheard of, or unimaginable, for uci,  chisholm said.  so it was a really big thing in terms of the school s reputation. i think, outside of this area, a lot of people didn t really know about uci,  she added.  but they did after that. by mid-morning, chisholm said, a few scientists in the chemistry department were tipsy from champagne. and the usually reserved rowland   who didn t drink alcohol   was posing for photos, raising a carton of milk alongside flutes and bottles.for reines, who by the autumn of 1995 appeared to be struggling with cognitive health issues, news of the award apparently sparked a brief rally. he came into the office at the physics department and, according to people who knew him at the time, seemed to be more alert. a few weeks later, at the nobel ceremony in sweden, reines   an enthusiastic baritone who once sang with the light opera troop at los alamos, new mexico, where his work helped to usher in the nuclear age   sang along in a choir with other winners.the workanother thing you should know about nobel prizes: they re usually late.that s by design. science and math and economics and many of the other fields tracked by the nobel committee are busy worlds, with lots of people making lots of discoveries and insights. it can take decades, and context, to know which advances are monumental and which fall into the category of important-but-smaller steps forward.the nobels awarded in 1995 followed that basic premise. the work that eventually meant recognition for rowland and reines had happened decades earlier.reines, who was 77 when he won the nobel, spent much of world war ii working on the manhattan project, which developed the atom bomb at secret labs in los alamos. he then spent about 15 post-war years continuing towork on atomic issues in los alamos, where he studied, among other things, the after-effects of nuclear explosions.during this period, reines and a los alamos co-worker, clyde cowan, started to work on detecting neutrinos, a subatomic particle that had been theorized in the 1930s but, in the mid-1950s, had not been proven to exist.in 1956, after conducting what was known as the cowan-reines neutrino experiment at the savannah river nuclear reactor in south carolina, they published a paper showing how they  observed the electron neutrino,  reines wrote later.the nobel committee echoed that, saying reines  honor was  for the detection of the neutrino. rowland, who was 68 when he won the nobel, first published groundbreaking ozone work in the 1970s.after starting his career working in carbon dating   a process that involves tracking the decay of radioactive isotopes   the former semi-pro baseball player studied radiochemistry, which involves the use of radioactive substances in everything from power to medicine.in the early 1970s, less than a decade after he d launched the chemistry department at uci, rowland started working on atmospheric calculations with mario j. molina, a mexico-born chemical engineer who studied and taught at uc berkeley. in 1974, rowland and molina published a study that theorized how man-made organic compound gases   including chemicals used in everything from air conditioners to asthma inhalers   could be broken down by the sun at higher elevations and, once broken down, could degrade the ozone layer, which protects life on earth from radiation.the basic idea   that a disappearing ozone layer would be bad thing, and man-made stuff was making it happen   caught on. within a couple years, the somewhat inaccurate idea of a growing  hole in the ozone layer,  likely growing over the poles, became cocktail party banter. what sherry and mario had was more of a theory initially, with no measurements. but it was a paper that explained, simply, that this is what could happen, and it was powerful,  said donald j. blake, a

(courtesy of uci libraries  special collections and archives)byandre mouchard|amouchard@scng.com| orange county registerpublished:october 10, 2025 at 12:13 pm pdtto understand why oct. 11, 1995, was such a big deal foruc irvineand two of the school s best-known scientists   the late sherwood  sherry  rowland, a radiochemist who theorized that man-made stuff was eroding the ozone layer, and the late fred reines, a physicist who proved the existence of neutrinos   you have to consider the pop-culture relevance of science-orientednobel prizes.for non-scientists, nobel news can rise to the level ofalmostinteresting.maybe you see a nobel science story and read about why a particular prize was awarded, learning a little about physics or math or whatever until the information becomes too complicated. maybe you see a picture and wonder how somebody who looks like your sweetest auntie is also professor-level smart. or, maybe, you skip the news entirely until the peace prize is awarded but still understand, somehow, that any nobel prize is a big deal.but for scientists, nobels are bigger than big. think oscar plus a pulitzer, plus, say, soccer s biggest prize, the ballon d or.other awards might honor scientific achievement and carry prestige within a specific field, but they don t come with much in the way of non-scientific fame. for people who can spend entire careers focused on arcane problems or ideas, even a little popular recognition can be a life-changing path to consulting gigs or long-term funding or, with luck, to others building on your work after you re gone.for rowland and reines   and for their employer, uc irvine   the separate nobel prizes each man won 30 years ago this week were all of that and more.uc irvine professor f. sherwood rowland, left, receives the nobel prize for chemistry from swedish king carl xvi gustaf, right, at the concert hall in stockholm, sweden sunday dec. 10 1995. professor rowland, of the university of california at irvine, in irvine, calif., shares the chemistry prize with mario molina, also of the united states, and paul j. crutzen of the netherlands. (ap photo/eric roxfelt)the day the morning was just insanely chaotic,  said barbara chisholm, an administrative analyst at uc irvine who was assistant to rowland the day he was one of three people to win the 1995 nobel prize in chemistry for their work regarding ozone depletion. you ve got to remember, technology wasn t the same,  she added.  the day before dr. rowland won, his internet started working for the first time. news was still spread by word of mouth or by phone. that morning, a wednesday, it was mostly by phone. chisholm s three-line headset was clogged with calls, most from people eager to be sure that rowland was aware that reines, a long-time colleague (and, like rowland, one of two professors who launched science departments when uci opened in 1965) hadwon the 1995 nobel for physics.finally, one of the callers was a top official at uci who got rowland, not chisholm, on the line. like the others, he wanted to tell rowland about reines  award. yeah,  rowland replied, almost casually. i won one, too. a few schools   caltech, mit, columbia and uc berkeley this year   have been connected to multiple nobel winners in the same year. until 1995, uc irvine would have been viewed as a long shot to join that list. winning two different nobels, in the same year, was kind of unheard of, or unimaginable, for uci,  chisholm said.  so it was a really big thing in terms of the school s reputation. i think, outside of this area, a lot of people didn t really know about uci,  she added.  but they did after that. by mid-morning, chisholm said, a few scientists in the chemistry department were tipsy from champagne. and the usually reserved rowland   who didn t drink alcohol   was posing for photos, raising a carton of milk alongside flutes and bottles.for reines, who by the autumn of 1995 appeared to be struggling with cognitive health issues, news of the award apparently sparked a brief rally. he came into the office at the physics department and, according to people who knew him at the time, seemed to be more alert. a few weeks later, at the nobel ceremony in sweden, reines   an enthusiastic baritone who once sang with the light opera troop at los alamos, new mexico, where his work helped to usher in the nuclear age   sang along in a choir with other winners.the workanother thing you should know about nobel prizes: they re usually late.that s by design. science and math and economics and many of the other fields tracked by the nobel committee are busy worlds, with lots of people making lots of discoveries and insights. it can take decades, and context, to know which advances are monumental and which fall into the category of important-but-smaller steps forward.the nobels awarded in 1995 followed that basic premise. the work that eventually meant recognition for rowland and reines had happened decades earlier.reines, who was 77 when he won the nobel, spent much of world war ii working on the manhattan project, which developed the atom bomb at secret labs in los alamos. he then spent about 15 post-war years continuing towork on atomic issues in los alamos, where he studied, among other things, the after-effects of nuclear explosions.during this period, reines and a los alamos co-worker, clyde cowan, started to work on detecting neutrinos, a subatomic particle that had been theorized in the 1930s but, in the mid-1950s, had not been proven to exist.in 1956, after conducting what was known as the cowan-reines neutrino experiment at the savannah river nuclear reactor in south carolina, they published a paper showing how they  observed the electron neutrino,  reines wrote later.the nobel committee echoed that, saying reines  honor was  for the detection of the neutrino. rowland, who was 68 when he won the nobel, first published groundbreaking ozone work in the 1970s.after starting his career working in carbon dating   a process that involves tracking the decay of radioactive isotopes   the former semi-pro baseball player studied radiochemistry, which involves the use of radioactive substances in everything from power to medicine.in the early 1970s, less than a decade after he d launched the chemistry department at uci, rowland started working on atmospheric calculations with mario j. molina, a mexico-born chemical engineer who studied and taught at uc berkeley. in 1974, rowland and molina published a study that theorized how man-made organic compound gases   including chemicals used in everything from air conditioners to asthma inhalers   could be broken down by the sun at higher elevations and, once broken down, could degrade the ozone layer, which protects life on earth from radiation.the basic idea   that a disappearing ozone layer would be bad thing, and man-made stuff was making it happen   caught on. within a couple years, the somewhat inaccurate idea of a growing  hole in the ozone layer,  likely growing over the poles, became cocktail party banter. what sherry and mario had was more of a theory initially, with no measurements. but it was a paper that explained, simply, that this is what could happen, and it was powerful,  said donald j. blake, a distinguished professor of chemistry at uc irvine who studied under rowland and worked with him for decades.by the late 1970s, california and other states were banning the use of the chemicals noted by rowland and molina. if true, and left unattended, what they were saying meant we were releasing gases into the atmosphere that could lead to ozone loss everywhere,  blake added.  that was something everybody could understand. two decades later, the nobel commentary on their 1995 award, which also included dutch-born meteorologist paul j. crutzen, was to the point:  for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone. nobel laureate frederick reines sizes up a bust of himself at uc irvine in this 1997 file photo. the university honored the distinguished career of the renowned scientist by unveiling the bust and renaming a physical sciences building frederick reines hall. reines, who came to uci in 1966, won the nobel prize in physics in 1995 for his research confirming the existence of the neutrino, an abundant but highly elusive subatomic particle. (ap photo/paul kennedy)the legaciesneutrinos, in the early 1950s, were intriguing to many but studied by few. the paper published by reines and cowan in 1956, demonstrating the existence of neutrinos, changed that, kicking off nothing less than a new branch of science.today, there are a few thousand scientists working on neutrino research in places as diverse as the super-kamiokande (super-k) project in japan and the detector located about a mile underground at the sanford underground research facility in south dakota and a 5,000-sensor neutrino observatory on the south pole known as icecube. they re called mysterious particles, yet they re so damn important to the universe,  said hank sobel, an emeritus professor of physics at uci and a former reines graduate student who has spent his career building on the neutrino discovery from 1956 and who has helped lead some of the research in japan and the united states.neutrinos are a lot of things; impossibly small with no electric charge and laughably difficult to detect. they re also somewhat solitary, because they rarely interact with matter. and they re ubiquitous   several billion neutrinos are passing through your body as you read this sentence.but a big reason science is interested in neutrinos is this: they re historical documents.neutrinos are remnants of the big bang, and so-called  relic  neutrinos were created within one second of the big bang and continue to travel through the universe. knowing more about them means knowing more about the biggest mysteries of all existence. for scientists of a certain bent, it s intoxicating stuff. like a lot of basic knowledge, the work in neutrino research has created things that are of use   mri machines and better and better magnets,  sobel said. but, really, studying neutrinos is a way of trying to understand why the universe is as it is,  he added. a big question right now is about dark matter. why is it what it is? what is it? those are things that still compel me. it s hard,  sobel added.  it s hard and it s fun. i m an experimentalist; i still like working with things and building with my hands. that s what this research is about. the echo from rowland s work might be easier to understand.in 1987, eight years before rowland s nobel, countries around the world agreed to form the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, a self-explanatory international treaty that ends the use of the chemicals that eat ozone. it was sparked by research by rowland and others, which eventually proved the theories about ozone depletion and how it might be reversed.according to federal reports and international monitoring, the montreal protocol has indeed reversed ozone degradation. the once-shrinking ozone layer is on track to full recovery within the next century.along with that, according to the nonprofit climate leadership council, a more robust ozone layer has helped reduce skin cancers and other radiation-related illness, with an estimated 3 million people alive today who otherwise would have died if the ozone layer had continued to degrade at the rates tracked in the 1970s and  80s. an improved ozone layer also has blunted some effects of global warming   including the loss of phytoplankton, which have been reduced because of steps launched by the agreement.uci s blake suggests those gains are direct results of the work by rowland and others. he also believes his friend   who he said  autographed a lot of chemistry books after he won the nobel    would be frustrated to see the world react differently to global warming than it did to ozone.but blake argues attitude, as much as science, is rowland s true legacy. i started with him when i was a graduate student. and he told us, all of us,  if you have a chance, at some junction in your career, to work on issues that benefit mankind, i suggest you try,   blake said. that s something i ve always remembered. frederick reines and f. sherwood rowland in 1967. on oct. 11, 1995, sherwood  sherry  rowland and fred reines, professors at uci, won nobel prizes for their work in chemistry and physics.

    "text": "as nobel prize goes to venezuela's opposition leader, how far would trump go to help her?10 october 2025sharesaveione wellssouth america correspondentsharesavegetty imagesthis nobel prize win for maria corina machado is being hugely welcomed by the opposition in venezuela.the hope is it will draw renewed international attention to their cause.responding to the prize, machado directly called for help from the man who had hoped he would win it.\"today more than ever we count on president trump,\" machado said.she hopes through the help of him, the us, other nations in latin america and \"democratic nations of the world\", venezuela will \"achieve freedom and democracy.\"the question is: how far will donald trump go?venezuelan opposition leader mar a corina machado wins nobel peace prizethere is a lot at stake in venezuela right now.picture a country where millions of people live in poverty. basic services, like electricity, are unreliable in many areas. the health system is in crisis, with acute medicine shortages. millions of people citizens have fled in recent years, many to the us or neighbouring countries.the last election was widely dismissed internationally as neither free nor fair. security forces cracked down on protests after the vote, with many people detained. human rights organisations believe there are still hundreds of political prisoners.more recently, the us has started bombing boats off the country's coast   in international waters   which it alleges carry drug traffickers. lawyers say the strikes could breach international law.this is just a snapshot of the situation in and around venezuela right now. in any other world, it would be a huge story.but the opposition, who the us among others say won the last election, has been left with few obvious paths forward to enact real change.machado, its de facto leader, is in hiding in venezuela. the opposition candidate edmundo gonz lez, who the us and others recognise as president-elect, lives in exile. both face threats and have been accused of \"treason\" by the government.machado briefly appeared at a protest ahead of president nicol s maduro's inauguration in january, but was arrested and then released.the widespread protests that took place after the last election have subsided in frequency, due to fears of repercussions for demonstrators.calls from the opposition for the military and security forces to abandon president maduro have so far not produced significant defections. they, and other key militia groups, remain loyal to the president.there is, though, a question about how far the opposition's allies   including the us   might be prepared to go to intervene.'i have no words': how mar a corina machado received nobel newsin recent weeks, the us has bombed at least four boats in the caribbean sea off the coast of venezuela in international waters, killing at least 21 people. the us claims they are drug-trafficking vessels but has not provided any details about those on board.some lawyers believe the strikes breach international law, but a recent leaked memo sent to congress said the us is now defining itself as being in a \"non-international armed conflict\"   suggesting it intends to justify using wartime powers against alleged cartels.while it is true that cartels, such as tren de aragua, do have a presence in the region some of these vessels are alleged to have come from in venezuela   this is by no stretch the largest trafficking hotspot in latin america.that has led many in the region to suspect that donald trump's real objective of these strikes, coupled with building up a us military presence in the region, is to exert military pressure on maduro and remove him from power.the pentagon has now reportedly built up a force of thousands of troops in the region and has been planning potential military operations. special operations forces have been sighted by neighbouring caribbean islands, such as trinidad and tobago.grenada's foreign ministry has said it is reviewing a us government request to temporarily install radar equipment and technical personnel at its airport.venezuela's defence minister, vladimir padrino l pez, has warned about possible us attacks with drones or special forces carrying out \"selective assassinations\". the president of neighbouring colombia, gustavo petro, has claimed that a \"new war scenario has opened up\" in the caribbean.in venezuela, civilian reserves have been preparing for a potential us attack.us administration officials argue that maduro sits on top of venezuela's cartel network, something that he denies, so it is believed the us would argue that removing him from power is ultimately a 'counter-narcotics' operation.in august, the us doubled a reward for any information leading to his arrest to $50m and accused him of being \"one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world\"   something the government dismissed as \"pathetic.\"venezuela has co-operated with some repatriation flights of migrants from the us, but this has not tamed trump's wrath for maduro.on friday, the new york times reported that venezuelan officials offered the trump administration a dominant stake in venezuela's heavily-sanctioned oil, gold and minerals resources   but that the trump administration refused the offer.the trump administration may have rebuffed the nobel peace prize committee and accused it of being \"political\" for not awarding it to the us president. but, for now, he remains an ally of the venezuelan opposition and a fierce opponent of maduro.cbs news - the bbc's us partner - understands trump called machado to congratulate her, saying she deserves the award.it remains unclear whether the us will keep its operations to targeting these small vessels in the caribbean sea   or has wider plans to target more senior figures within the maduro administration.venezuela may not have many allies on the world stage, but there are notable exceptions including china, russia, iran, and cuba.if the us decides to intervene on venezuelan soil, the situation could escalate very fast.venezuelan opposition

of which there were 338 - closed at the end of january, not long after trump returned to the white house.the prize honours actions carried out in 2024, which was the year in which he was elected but not yet in office.however, over the course of his two terms in the oval office trump had been nominated for the award more than 10 times - by israel's benjamin netanyahu, cambodia's prime minister hun manet, a ukrainian politician, as well as legislators from the us, sweden, and norway.but a nomination alone does not guarantee someone will be a candidate and the prize committee does not publish a list of candidates before the winner is announced.it is not clear if any of trump's nominations came before the january deadline.trump's name swirled in the media as a potential winner after his groundbreaking brokering of the peace agreement between hamas and israel.the accord, if fully implemented, would bring the two sides closer than any previous effort to halt a war that had evolved into a regional conflict that has reshaped the middle east.the deal was struck under pressure from the us president who made no secret of the fact that he believed he is worthy of the nobel peace prize.trump has previously said that it would be a 'big insult' were he not to receive the prize and has put pressure on the norwegian nobel committee, claiming to have 'solved' seven wars.'i've done six wars, i've ended six wars,' he said on august 18, during his summit with ukrainian and european leaders.'if you look at the six deals i settled this year, they were all at war. i didn't do any ceasefires.'the following day, in an interview with fox news, he revised the number to seven wars. it's a claim he went on to repeat last month, saying that no one had 'ever done anything close to that'.netanyahu publicly nominated trump in july, saying he was 'forging peace as we speak' in 'one country and one region after the other'.it came after trump took credit for stopping iran and israel's '12-day war' the month prior.displaced palestinians gather on a road blocked by israeli tanks in gaza after the peace plan is announced on october 9smoke rises after israeli airstrikes targeted areas in the gaza strip despite the announcement of a cease-fire agreement, as seen from the israeli city of sderot near the border, on october 9your browser does not support iframes.read morepoll of the day: does donald trump deserve to win the nobel peace prize?prior to his victory, trump even phoned jens stoltenberg, the former head of nato and now norway's finance minister, to lobby for the prize, according to norwegian media.his feat is the peace plan in gaza, which will see hamas release all 20 living hostages in the coming days in exchange for palestinian prisoners, while the israeli military will begin a withdrawal from the majority of gaza.netanyahu said the 'great efforts of our great friend and ally president trump' had helped them reach 'this critical turning point'.the israeli military said on friday that the gaza ceasefire agreement went into effect at midday local time.'since 12.00am, idf troops began positioning themselves along the updated deployment lines in preparation for the ceasefire agreement and the return of hostages', the israeli military said.israel and hamas agreed to trump's peace plan late on wednesday - a day after the second anniversary of hamas militants' cross-border attack that triggered israel's devastating assault on gaza.but the deal announced by trump was short on detail and left many unresolved questions that could still lead to its collapse, as has happened with previous peace efforts.successful completion of the deal would mark a significant foreign policy achievement for the republican president, who had campaigned on bringing peace to major world conflicts but has struggled to swiftly deliver, both in gaza and on russia's invasion of ukraine.'i am very proud to announce that israel and hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,' trump said on truth social.israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said in a written statement, referring to the hostages held by hamas: 'with god's help we will bring them all home.' he said he would convene his government on thursday to approve the agreement.the nobel peace prize creator alfred nobel previously said the award should be given to the person who has done the 'most or best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses'.a woman in the colours of the us flag holds up a placard thanking us president donald trump in tel aviv's hostage square on october 9, 2025, following the announcement of a new gaza ceasefire dealread morebookies reveal new odds on trump's chances of winning nobel peace prize after gaza breakthroughhowever several experts around the world did not believe that trump had fully lived up to this criteria.'he has withdrawn the us from the world health organisation and from the paris accord on climate, he has initiated a trade war on old friends and allies,' nina graeger, director of the peace research institute oslo, toldsky news.'that is not exactly what we think about when we think about a peaceful president or someone who really is interested in promoting peace,' she added.however, graeger believes that if his peace plan for gaza materialises and holds, trump could be a contender next year.during trump's second term, he had also proposed measures that critics argued will hamper education and scientific research - two areas that are considered pillars of the nobel prize.they included slashing the budget for the national institutes of health, the world's largest funder of biomedical research, and plans to dismantle the department of education to shrink the federal government's role in education in favour of more control by the states.ylva engstrom, vice president of the royal swedish academy of sciences, which awards three of the six nobel prizes - for chemistry, physics and economics - said she believed trump's changes are reckless and could have 'devastating effects'.'academic freedom... is one of the pillars of the democratic system,' she said prior to his defeat.the trump administration denied stifling a academic freedom as they argued its measures will cut waste and promote scientific innovation.trump critics also noted his controversial us immigration and customs enforcement (ice) agency, through which the president has been sending troops to a string of democratic-led cities to enforce his immigration laws.benjamin netanyahu has posted an ai image of himself presenting donald trump with a nobel peace prize medallionit comes after netanyahu posted an ai image of himself presenting trump with a nobel peace prize medallion on theisraeliprime minister's official x account.it shows trump lifting his hands in the air as he sports an oversized medal and is showered in confetti in front of a cheering crowd waving israeli flags.the us president is stood under a banner reading 'peace through strength'.'give [donald trump] the nobel peace prize   he deserves it,' the post is captioned.previous to the announcement of this year's winner, russia said it would back the us president's candidature for the prestigious prize, state news agency tass quoted kremlin aide yuri ushakov as saying on friday.and on thursday, ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said kyiv would nominate trump in exchange for tomahawk missiles, the american-made subsonic precision weapon that launches from ships and submarines.machado won the prize for being one of the most 'extraordinary examples' of civilian courage in latin america in recent years.the election results announced by the electoral council last year sparked protests across the country to which the government responded with force and ended with more than 20 people dead.they also prompted an end to diplomatic relations between venezuela and various foreign countries, including argentina.machado went into hiding and has not been seen in public since january.a venezuelan court issued an arrest warrant for gonz lez, who moved to spain and was granted asylum.share or comment on this article: donald trump is snubbed by nobel peace prize judges: us president's achievements are ignored, despite brokering peace in gazae-mail392sharesadd commentcomments5907share what you thinknewestoldestbest ratedworst ratedview allthe comments below have not been moderated.view allthe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of mailonline.add your commententer your commentby posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.submit commentclearclosedo you want to automatically post your mailonline comments to your facebook timeline?your comment will be posted to mailonline as usual.noyesclosedo you want to automatically post your mailonline comments to your facebook timeline?your comment will be posted to mailonline as usualwe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on mailonline. to do this we will link your mailonline account with your facebook account. we ll ask you to confirm this for your first post to facebook.you can choose on each post whether you would like it to be posted to facebook. your details from facebook will be used to provide you with tailored content, marketing and ads in line with ourprivacy policy."

of which there were 338 - closed at the end of january, not long after trump returned to the white house.the prize honours actions carried out in 2024, which was the year in which he was elected but not yet in office.however, over the course of his two terms in the oval office trump had been nominated for the award more than 10 times - by israel's benjamin netanyahu, cambodia's prime minister hun manet, a ukrainian politician, as well as legislators from the us, sweden, and norway.but a nomination alone does not guarantee someone will be a candidate and the prize committee does not publish a list of candidates before the winner is announced.it is not clear if any of trump's nominations came before the january deadline.trump's name swirled in the media as a potential winner after his groundbreaking brokering of the peace agreement between hamas and israel.the accord, if fully implemented, would bring the two sides closer than any previous effort to halt a war that had evolved into a regional conflict that has reshaped the middle east.the deal was struck under pressure from the us president who made no secret of the fact that he believed he is worthy of the nobel peace prize.trump has previously said that it would be a 'big insult' were he not to receive the prize and has put pressure on the norwegian nobel committee, claiming to have 'solved' seven wars.'i've done six wars, i've ended six wars,' he said on august 18, during his summit with ukrainian and european leaders.'if you look at the six deals i settled this year, they were all at war. i didn't do any ceasefires.'the following day, in an interview with fox news, he revised the number to seven wars. it's a claim he went on to repeat last month, saying that no one had 'ever done anything close to that'.netanyahu publicly nominated trump in july, saying he was 'forging peace as we speak' in 'one country and one region after the other'.it came after trump took credit for stopping iran and israel's '12-day war' the month prior.displaced palestinians gather on a road blocked by israeli tanks in gaza after the peace plan is announced on october 9smoke rises after israeli airstrikes targeted areas in the gaza strip despite the announcement of a cease-fire agreement, as seen from the israeli city of sderot near the border, on october 9your browser does not support iframes.read morepoll of the day: does donald trump deserve to win the nobel peace prize?prior to his victory, trump even phoned jens stoltenberg, the former head of nato and now norway's finance minister, to lobby for the prize, according to norwegian media.his feat is the peace plan in gaza, which will see hamas release all 20 living hostages in the coming days in exchange for palestinian prisoners, while the israeli military will begin a withdrawal from the majority of gaza.netanyahu said the 'great efforts of our great friend and ally president trump' had helped them reach 'this critical turning point'.the israeli military said on friday that the gaza ceasefire agreement went into effect at midday local time.'since 12.00am, idf troops began positioning themselves along the updated deployment lines in preparation for the ceasefire agreement and the return of hostages', the israeli military said.israel and hamas agreed to trump's peace plan late on wednesday - a day after the second anniversary of hamas militants' cross-border attack that triggered israel's devastating assault on gaza.but the deal announced by trump was short on detail and left many unresolved questions that could still lead to its collapse, as has happened with previous peace efforts.successful completion of the deal would mark a significant foreign policy achievement for the republican president, who had campaigned on bringing peace to major world conflicts but has struggled to swiftly deliver, both in gaza and on russia's invasion of ukraine.'i am very proud to announce that israel and hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan,' trump said on truth social.israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said in a written statement, referring to the hostages held by hamas: 'with god's help we will bring them all home.' he said he would convene his government on thursday to approve the agreement.the nobel peace prize creator alfred nobel previously said the award should be given to the person who has done the 'most or best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses'.a woman in the colours of the us flag holds up a placard thanking us president donald trump in tel aviv's hostage square on october 9, 2025, following the announcement of a new gaza ceasefire dealread morebookies reveal new odds on trump's chances of winning nobel peace prize after gaza breakthroughhowever several experts around the world did not believe that trump had fully lived up to this criteria.'he has withdrawn the us from the world health organisation and from the paris accord on climate, he has initiated a trade war on old friends and allies,' nina graeger, director of the peace research institute oslo, toldsky news.'that is not exactly what we think about when we think about a peaceful president or someone who really is interested in promoting peace,' she added.however, graeger believes that if his peace plan for gaza materialises and holds, trump could be a contender next year.during trump's second term, he had also proposed measures that critics argued will hamper education and scientific research - two areas that are considered pillars of the nobel prize.they included slashing the budget for the national institutes of health, the world's largest funder of biomedical research, and plans to dismantle the department of education to shrink the federal government's role in education in favour of more control by the states.ylva engstrom, vice president of the royal swedish academy of sciences, which awards three of the six nobel prizes - for chemistry, physics and economics - said she believed trump's changes are reckless and could have 'devastating effects'.'academic freedom... is one of the pillars of the democratic system,' she said prior to his defeat.the trump administration denied stifling a academic freedom as they argued its measures will cut waste and promote scientific innovation.trump critics also noted his controversial us immigration and customs enforcement (ice) agency, through which the president has been sending troops to a string of democratic-led cities to enforce his immigration laws.benjamin netanyahu has posted an ai image of himself presenting donald trump with a nobel peace prize medallionit comes after netanyahu posted an ai image of himself presenting trump with a nobel peace prize medallion on theisraeliprime minister's official x account.it shows trump lifting his hands in the air as he sports an oversized medal and is showered in confetti in front of a cheering crowd waving israeli flags.the us president is stood under a banner reading 'peace through strength'.'give [donald trump] the nobel peace prize   he deserves it,' the post is captioned.previous to the announcement of this year's winner, russia said it would back the us president's candidature for the prestigious prize, state news agency tass quoted kremlin aide yuri ushakov as saying on friday.and on thursday, ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said kyiv would nominate trump in exchange for tomahawk missiles, the american-made subsonic precision weapon that launches from ships and submarines.machado won the prize for being one of the most 'extraordinary examples' of civilian courage in latin america in recent years.the election results announced by the electoral council last year sparked protests across the country to which the government responded with force and ended with more than 20 people dead.they also prompted an end to diplomatic relations between venezuela and various foreign countries, including argentina.machado went into hiding and has not been seen in public since january.a venezuelan court issued an arrest warrant for gonz lez, who moved to spain and was granted asylum.share or comment on this article: donald trump is snubbed by nobel peace prize judges: us president's achievements are ignored, despite brokering peace in gazae-mail392sharesadd commentcomments5907share what you thinknewestoldestbest ratedworst ratedview allthe comments below have not been moderated.view allthe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of mailonline.add your commententer your commentby posting your comment you agree to ourhouse rules.submit commentclearclosedo you want to automatically post your mailonline comments to your facebook timeline?your comment will be posted to mailonline as usual.noyesclosedo you want to automatically post your mailonline comments to your facebook timeline?your comment will be posted to mailonline as usualwe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on mailonline. to do this we will link your mailonline account with your facebook account. we ll ask you to confirm this for your first post to facebook.you can choose on each post whether you would like it to be posted to facebook. your details from facebook will be used to provide you with tailored content, marketing and ads in line with ourprivacy policy."

    "text": "credit: ill. niklas elmehed   nobel prize outreachomar m. yaghi received the 2025 nobel prize in chemistry.newswise   omar m. yaghi, a chemist supported by the department of energy s (doe) office of science, has been awarded the 2025 nobel prize in chemistry. his award is  for the development of metal organic frameworks,  along with susumu kitagawa of japan and richard robson of australia.because of their research, metal-organic frameworks (mofs) now provide chemists with a powerful tool to facilitate and manage chemical reactions. mofs can separate pollutants from water, capture water in deserts, and hold reactive gases. to date, chemists have developed tens of thousands of different mofs, which have numerous potential applications. the nobel prize committee s recognition of omar m. yaghi s work demonstrates how discovery science supported by the department of energy lays the foundation for major technological advances,  said dar ogil, doe under secretary for science.  metal-organic frameworks have the potential to provide solutions to some of our greatest scientific challenges. solving a chemical conundrumbefore the 1990s, chemists constructed most new molecules through trial and error. they would combine and heat chemicals to produce new molecules with a known formula. however, it was very hard to predict molecules  chemical properties with this method. in addition, chemists wanted to create chemicals that could hold and release gases or liquids. but developing those materials required scientists to be able to reliably create consistent 3d structures with holes.the path to developing mofs provided a solution to both of those challenges.in the 1980s, one of yaghi s co-recipients, richard robson, realized he might be able to use the ways atoms are inherently attracted to each other to predictably link up different types of molecules. inspired by a molecular toolkit he was building for his chemistry students, he put together positively charged copper ions with a certain type of molecule. the molecule had four arms. each of these arms had a chemical group at the end of it that was attracted to the copper. driven by the attraction between the ions and molecules, the chemicals organized themselves. the result had a predictable crystalline structure with empty spaces inside of it. robson published the first article on this structure in 1989. however, his molecules were unstable and not very practical.starting in 1992, susumu kitagawa built on this work in his research in japan. he both built mofs that could absorb and release different gases without changing shape as well as described what made mofs unique.from library to labat the same time as kitagawa, yaghi began tackling the same challenge from a different angle. he wanted a more consistent, predictable way to create molecules that didn t produce unnecessary side-products.like many scientists, yaghi s love of chemistry was rooted in a formative childhood experience. growing up in a single room with no running water or electricity, school was an outlet for his curiosity. one day, he took advantage of the unlocked school library and snuck in. grabbing a random book off the shelf, he flipped through the pages. there, an illustration of chemical structures caught his eye. even though he didn t know what they were, he was hooked.that initial spark of knowledge directed him towards research. when he was 15, he immigrated from jordan to the united states to pursue his education. after graduating with a phd in chemistry from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign, he started as a research group leader at arizona state university in 1992.while at arizona state, yaghi imagined being able to connect different molecules together to make large crystals. like robson, he started by combining metal ions with organic molecules. in only a few years, his team had developed two net-like 2d materials held together with copper or cobalt. the cobalt ones were particularly promising   they were stable and could hold other molecules. in a 1995 article innature, he and his team coined the term metal-organic framework.by 1999, yaghi and his team had developed and presented the compound mof-5. this structure is now used widely in the field of chemistry. what s particularly amazing about mof-5 is the amount of material it can hold. only a few grams of it can absorb enough material to cover a soccer field! it is also very stable, even at temperatures higher than 500 degrees f.this foundational discovery and others were made possible because of support from doe s office of science. the basic energy sciences program began funding his lab in 1998.building structures for discoverysince then, yaghi has continued his work supported by doe s office of science. in 2002 and 2003, he and his team published articles innatureandscienceshowing how it s possible to modify mofs to have specific properties.yaghi has also played important roles in the doe basic energy sciences community. he served as an early director of the molecular foundry, a doe office of science user facility at lawrence berkeley national laboratory. bes has also provided support for his work at the university of michigan, the university of california, los angeles, and the university of california, berkeley. his research has also used several beamlines at theadvanced light source, a doe office of science user facility also at berkeley lab.the future of mofsthe discoveries of yaghi, robson, and kitagawa have opened the door to new opportunities in chemistry.mofs offer huge potential for storing gases, including hydrogen and carbon dioxide. scientists also use them for chemical separation, purification, andcatalysis. chemists now have a set of building blocks to create new structures that can be used for a variety of different purposes.companies are beginning to produce mofs on a mass scale. the electronics industry is starting to use mofs to hold harmful gases used in the semiconductor production process. others are looking into using mofs to handle toxic gases from chemical weapons.driven by curiosity and the desire to improve a process, these nobel winners found a new way to develop and work with molecules. the foundation laid by discovery science in the past has set the stage for a wave of advances in the future.request an expertmedia contactregister for reporter access to contact detailstype of articleannouncementsectionsciencechannelschemistryethics and research methodspollutiontechnologykeywordsnobel prizenobel prize for chemistrymofsmetal-organic frameworkschemistrycomments|commenting policy"

credibility:fact-checkedtrusted sourcewritten by researcher(s)proofreadrichard robson was making a molecular model for class when he came up with the idea that became mofs. credit: paul burston/university of melbournethe 2025 nobel prize in chemistryhas been awardedfor the development of metal organic frameworks: molecular structures that have large spaces within them, capable of capturing and storing gases and other chemicals.theprize is sharedby susumu kitagawa from kyoto university, omar m. yaghi from the university of california, berkeley, and an australian professor richard robson from the university of melbourne.robson first discovered the metal organic frameworks, known as mofs for short, in 1989, with his close collaborator bernard hoskins.at a time when thevalue of research is being questioned, robson's story is a powerful reminder of howscientific researchleads to real-world impact after years of sustained effort and support.a personal connectionlike many other australian scientists, i was inspired to pursue research in mofs because of professor richard robson. he's still working in the lab at nearly 90, mentoring students, teaching and collaborating with many of us. this recognition honors richard's decades of dedication as a researcher and educator in coordination and inorganic chemistry.i've had the great fortune of being among his many collaborators, and he's left an indelible mark. with richard and his close colleague, university of melbourne professor richard abrahams, we have explored how electrons move aroundinside mofs.as young chemists, we first learned about richard's discovery in undergraduate lectures. it's an inspiring story of the deep connection between teaching and research in our universities.while the work that led to these materials was fundamental science, richard's achievement shows that deep, curiosity-driven research has critically important real-world impacts.what began as scientific curiosity for richard as he prepared models of chemicals to demonstrate to his undergraduate chemistry students, has grown into a transformative innovation. mofs are now helping solve some of the world's biggest challenges, from greenhouse gas capture to drug delivery and medical imaging.olof ramstr m, professor of organic chemistry and member of the nobel committee for chemistry, explains mofs.so, what are mofs?metal organic frameworks are incredibly porous crystalline materials that are made up of metal ions, linked by organic bridges.think of a sponge where the holes are on the atomic scale. one teaspoon of one of these materials can have a surface area of a football field.the shapes, sizes and functionality of these tiny pores can be changed, much like an architect designing a building where the rooms each have different functions and can carry out different tasks.there are now tens of thousands of mofs. some are used tocapture water from desert air. others have been designed to removegreenhouse gasessuch ascarbon dioxide from the atmosphere. yet otherscan clean earth's waterwaysby capturing and removing potentially harmful chemicals.the long road to real-world applicationswhile there are now companies scaling mofs to help address major global problems, richard began this work many decades ago.in 2018, in a plenary lecture at the6th global mofs conferencein auckland, new zealand, he described how he was preparing molecular models for a lecture when the idea struck him.discover the latest in science, tech, and space with over100,000 subscriberswho rely on phys.org for daily insights. sign up for ourfree newsletterand get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter daily or weekly.subscriberichard reasoned thatmetal ionssuch as copper could be connected in a systematic and controlled way to other atoms such as carbon and nitrogen using coordination chemistry. it's essentially like molecular lego, where one piece can only click into the other in a particular way.with his colleague bernard hoskins, they recognized that the geometric structure was ordered and contained innumerable cavities. over the following decade, fellow nobel recipients kitagawa and yaghi made subsequent discoveries that showed how these materials could be made stable, and designed in a controlled way.of the tens of thousands of mofs now known, a number are making it through to commercial application. for example, richard's work with brendan abrahams has shown these materials canremove excesses of anesthetic greenhouse gasesfrom operating room theaters. these greenhouse gases are many tens of thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide.mofs are also being usedto pull water out of thin air, especially important in dry and arid environments where there is water scarcity.at a time when australia isdebating the contribution of research, thevalue of higher education and universities, andhow to increase productivity, richard's legacy highlights the profound value of education and research, and the way they are deeply interconnected.but to truly thrive, they require sustained support over many years, far beyond the short-term horizon of political cycles.fundamental science, often driven by curiosity and without an immediate application, lays the groundwork for breakthroughs that can help solve the pressing challenges we face today and those yet to come.richard robson now joins just 11 other australian scientists whose work has been recognized with a nobel prize. all australians can be very proud of richard's achievement on the world stage.provided bythe conversationthis article is republished fromthe conversationunder a creative commons license. read theoriginal article.citation: an

current goal is to bring quantum computing out of the lab and into the hands of people who can use it.a california physicist and nobel laureate who laid the foundation for quantum computing isn t done working.for the last 40 years, john martinis has worked   mostly within california   to create the fastest computers ever built. it s kind of my professional dream to do this by the time i m really too old to retire. i should retire now, but i m not doing that,  the now 67-year-old said.advertisementborn and raised in san pedro, martinis said his california high school teachers influenced him to pursue his career. a physics teacher got him interested in the topic, he said, and a math teacher taught him rigor, work ethic and organization. i think before then i d just write down the solution  rather than showing his process, he joked in an interview with the times.as an undergraduate senior at uc berkeley in the 1980s, he met john clarke, a british physicist and professor who would become his graduate advisor, and michel devoret, a french physicist who worked with him as a postdoctoral researcher.advertisementjohn clarke, right, a professor emeritus of physics, looks on during a celebration at uc berkeley on oct. 7, 2025, after he and fellow physicists michel devoret and john martinis were awarded the 2025 nobel prize in physics for their work on quantum tunneling.(justin sullivan / getty images)world & nationthree university of california scientists win nobel prize in physics for quantum computing advancesit is the 119th time the prize has been awarded. last year, artificial intelligence pioneers john hopfield and geoffrey hinton won the physics prize for helping create the building blocks of machine learning.oct. 7, 2025 this was a fantastic experience, to be mentored by two wonderful people,  he said during a news conference tuesday at uc santa barbara, where he works as a professor.  i learned so much from them that, through my whole career, i was kind of trying to re-create that spirit that we had in there. martinis wasawarded the 2025 nobel prize in physics,alongside clarke and devoret, for his doctoral project, a series of experiments in the mid-1980s that proved quantum tunneling was possible with large objects, which became the basis for the development of quantum computers as well as much of the current research in that field.advertisementboth clarke and devoret are based in the u.s. and associated with the university of california system   clarke as a professor emeritus at berkeley and devoret as a professor at uc santa barbara. i loved berkeley. it was great to be taught by these really amazing professors,  martinis said, noting the university s cutting-edge facilities that supported the experiments.  as a student, i could focus on just being a good scientist. martinis went on to do a postdoctoral fellowship in france, then returned stateside to boulder, colo., where he worked at the national institute of standards and technology, a u.s. government lab. in 2008 he moved back to california to work at uc santa barbara as a professor, and in 2014, google hired him and devoret to create an experimental quantum processor faster than any human supercomputer   which his teamcompletedfive years later.advertisement it really was all this basic research we did for decades that enabled this to happen and enabled us to have a vision ... to build this thing,  martinis said.science & medicinegoogle claims quantum computing breakthroughgoogle, microsoft, ibm and intel have been pursuing quantum technology, which could vastly speed up information processing.oct. 23, 2019he chose uc santa barbara as a workplace not just because of the great location and weather, but also for its advanced facilities and community. researchers from other disciplines   such as engineers and materials scientists who build semiconductors   are able to freely communicate and collaborate with his team. working with talented and friendly people at the university is really special,  he said.  you can actually get things done. martinis said he has enjoyed hearing back from former students who have reached out to celebrate his award. speaking to students years after they take his classes and grasp the effect on their lives has been refreshing. his work over the years has spawned an industry that created thousands of well-paying jobs for people across the country, he said.he praised the uc system for its culture and collaboration with the private sector and government, but said that research and development for quantum computers in the u.s. must urgently speed up if we expect to see it in our lifetimes.after leaving google in 2020, martinis co-founded his private company, qolab, in 2022 with a belief that advanced semiconductor chips are the path to achieving usable quantum computers. the company has begun collaborating with other startup companies and academic groups involved in semiconductor production, he said.advertisement i think this collaborative model is going to be more fruitful because we really get a lot of interesting ideas,  martinis said.  we have a lot to catch up on. but it s a very good atmosphere to invent things. more to reada caltech nobel laureate celebrates his 100th birthday. then he gets back to workjuly 21, 2023california scientist, two others win

metal-organic frameworks, or mofs, which are tunable crystal structures with extremely high porosity. these are a class of materials that have truly changed the way scientists design and think about matter, inspiring progress in various applications.i'm a mof scientistand for many of us in the field, this recognition feels both historic and deeply personal. mofs are not just elegant crystals you'd admire under a microscope; they're an entire universe of structures, each like a miniature city of tunnels and rooms waiting to be filled. they've been my scientific home since i first stepped into research, and they still feel a little bit like magic to me.so, what exactly are mofs?metal-organic frameworks are like crystalline scaffolds built from two ingredients: metals that act like connective joints and organic that is, carbon-based molecules that behave as bridges to link those joints in a repeating pattern. the result is a highly ordered, porous framework a kind of molecular architecture that's both sturdy and full of empty space.these frameworks are so porous, like sponges with tiny voids, that it's almost impossible to picture them. one gram of a mof has so many pores that it can expose as much internalsurface area as a soccer field. it's astonishing that a handful of powder could hide an entire landscape of surface within it.that enormous surface area is one of the unique things that make mofs so powerful, and it comes from the nanoscale pores tiny molecular rooms that can trap, separate, transform or transport gases,ionsand other molecules. in a way, mofs are like molecular hotels with countless doors, each programmed to admit only certain guests.why scientists love themwhat fascinates me most aboutmetal-organic frameworksis their limitless design space. just by glancing at the periodic table, every metal could, in principle, serve as a cornerstone, and countless organic molecules can act as bridges connecting them. even using the same combination can produce entirely different architectures.chemist omar farha compares metal-organic frameworks to lego sets that you can build and customize.so far, scientists havesynthesized more than 90,000 mofs, and computational chemists have predicted hundreds of thousands more. few material families offer this much versatility.i like to think of mofs as puzzles or lego sets, but on the atomic scale. you can replace a single piece, or change its color or shape, and end up with a material that behaves completely differently.add a new \"decoration\" what chemists call afunctional group and the framework suddenly recognizes a new molecule. stretch the organic bridges, and the same architecture inflates like a balloon, giving what we callisoreticular mofs. these have the same structure, but bigger pores. in short, mofs can come in almost every imaginable shape, size and texture.discover the latest in science, tech, and space with over100,000 subscriberswho rely on phys.org for daily

scientific elegance, mofs are incredibly promising for real-world technologies. different structures and functionalities lead to different properties and, therefore, different uses.some mofs act as molecular sieves, selectivelycapturing carbon dioxidefrom industrial exhaust or even directly from air. othersclean polluted waterby removing heavy metals, dyes or \"forever chemicals.\"certain mofs can also carry drugs or imaging agents inside the bodyfor medical applications. in the energy world, they functionas electrodes or electrolytesthat make batteries safer and more efficient. and manyserve as catalysts, accelerating chemical reactions that transform one molecule into another.when i began my ph.d., my senior colleagues warned me that mofs might be too delicate beautiful crystals that would crumble at the first hint of air or moisture. and indeed, some of the early frameworks were fragile curiosities, admired more for their elegance than their endurance. but that perception has changed dramatically.many mofs are now remarkably robust. the material i first worked on was a titanium-based metal-organic frameworknamed mil-125. it was first reported by g rard f rey, one of the foundational figures in the mof and porous framework community who sadly died in 2017. mil-125 was not only stable, it was practically indestructible in my lab. after synthesizing two grams of it, i stored it on my bench in an open vial and used that same batch for every catalytic experiment throughout my ph.d. no glovebox,no desiccator just a jar of yellow powder sitting happily on my bench.that experience taught me something important: while stability can be a legitimate concern, mofs have grown up. thanks to smart chemistry, we have materials that canwithstand water, heat and repeated use. since their foundation, researchers around the world haveintroduced new properties to these materials from electrical conductivity to light responsiveness and, crucially, made major progress in scaling up mof synthesis for industrial applications.scaling is the key step in bridging the gap between fundamental discovery and large-scale deployment. researchers are no longer content with studying mofs in milligrams we're often planning for grams, kilograms and beyond.some startups are turning these advances into real technologies from storing gases more safely, to pullingclean water straight from desert air, to building moreenergy-efficient air conditioners. what once felt like science fiction powders that breathe, trap and transform molecules is now science fact.despite these advances, researchers will need to continue improving the stability and scalability of mofs to fully realize these materials' potential in the real world.a nobel moment that honors creativitythe 2025 nobel prize in chemistry goes beyondhonoring three remarkable scientists it celebrates an entire community: a generation of chemists and engineers who transformed a single idea into a thriving field. the pioneering visions of richard robson, susumu kitagawa and omar yaghi laid the foundations for a vibrant discipline that has grown to encompass everything from gas storage and catalysis to energy and environmental technologies.when i attended my first mof conference as a second-year ph.d. student, i listened in awe to many of the pioneers of this field, some of whom are now nobel laureates. back then, mofs felt like magical sponges, and that sense of wonder never left me. it led me to continue my research on conductive mofs: materials that can carry electricity. now, inmy own research group, we study how these frameworks can make batteries safer and more efficient, and how they can capture waste gases and turn them into useful chemicals using sunlight.for me, this nobel prize celebrates more than a discovery, it celebrates a philosophy: chemistry is creative, we can design and engineer matter with imagination, and sometimes emptiness can be the very essence of a material.provided bythe conversationthis article is republished fromthe conversationunder a creative commons license. read theoriginal article.citation: metal-organic frameworks: nobel-winning, tiny

simmonds/nistquantum mechanics describes the weird behavior of microscopic particles. using quantum systems to perform computation promises to allow researchersto solve problemsin areas from chemistry to cryptography that have so many possible solutions that they are beyond the capabilities of even the most powerful nonquantum computers possible.quantum computing depends on researchers developing practical quantum technologies. superconducting electrical circuits are a promising technology, but not so long ago it was unclear whether they even showedquantum behavior. the 2025nobel prize in physicswas awarded to three scientists for their work demonstrating that quantum effects persist even in large electrical circuits, which has enabled the development of practical quantum technologies.i'm a physicist whostudies superconducting circuitsfor quantum computing and other uses. the work in my field stems from the groundbreaking research the nobel laureates conducted.big, cold, quantumin their 1984 and 1985 work, then-ph.d. studentjohn martinis, then-postdoctoral researchermichel devoretand uc berkeley professorjohn clarkeshowed that even large electrical circuits could exhibit quantum behavior. they used a circuit made from niobium and lead. when cooled to a few degrees above absolute zero, these metals becomesuperconductors. a superconductor is a material that carries a current without generating any heat.martinis, devoret and clarke showed that in a superconductor, the voltages and currents are governed byquantum mechanics. the circuit has quantized meaning discrete and indivisible levels of energy, and it can be in superpositions of multiple states.any physical system can be described by a state, which tells you everything there is to know about that system. quantum mechanics shows that a state can have certain quantized values of things that can be measured. an example is energy: a particular system could have energy 1 or energy 2, but nothing in between. at the same time, a quantum system can be in a superposition of more than one state, much like you can add different amounts of red/green/blue to get any color in a pixel of an image.importantly, the laureates showed that researchers can describe one of thesesuperconducting circuitsas if it's a single quantum particle. this simple behavior is what makes superconducting circuits so useful as a technology.today, superconducting circuits are used to study fundamental quantum physics, to simulate other physical systems and to test protocols for ultraprecise sensing. for instance, the devoret group recently demonstrated anear-ideal microwave amplifierbased on a superconducting circuit. microwave amplifiers are widely used in communications, radar and scientific instruments.the martinis group has used superconducting circuits toemulate a group of electron-like particles. this type of simulation is a key technique in studying fundamental physics.in my own group, we recently used a superconducting circuit todemonstrate a protocolfor measuring amagnetic fieldmore sensitively than standard techniques. quantum sensors measure physical quantities with extreme precision, from biological activity to gravity anomalies.but by far the biggest application of superconducting circuits is as a platform for quantum computing.the quantum behavior of superconducting circuits like the small white square above was a major discovery. credit:k. cicak and r. simmonds/nistdiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over100,000 subscriberswho

computersmultiplequantum systemscan interact with each other and becomeentangled, so that they act like a single system. this combination of quantization, superposition and entanglement is what gives quantum computers their power.in quantum computing technology, researchers use a quantum system a quantum bit or qubit that can be in only two states. qubits need to be coherent. this means that if we put it in a particular state, we want it to stay there and not get randomly scrambled to another state. qubits need to be controllable. this means that researchers should be able to get a qubit to change state as needed and get it to interact with other qubits. and qubits need to be scalable, meaning that we need to make a lot of them.many technologies show promise, such as arrays of atoms in a vacuum, trapped ions, trapped electrons in semiconductors, and photons controlled by optical circuits. but all technologies make trade-offs, sacrificing coherence, controllability or scalability to improve something else.the simplicity and flexibility of superconducting circuits mean that by changing the design of the circuit, researchers can get almost any qubit behavior we want, and that behavior is easy to predict. this hits the technological sweet spot forquantum computing. more obviously, quantum technologies, such as trapped atoms, are so small that they can be hard to control and interact with. superconducting qubits are big enough to be easy to control, simple enough to be reliable and quantum enough to make the whole thing work.today, academic research groupslike minedevelop new types of superconducting qubits, look for ways to make them more coherent, try to improve our control of them, and develop techniques to make them easier to scale up. companies and government labs take these academic results along with their own basic research and apply them, doing the difficult engineering tocreate large-scale quantum processorsfor practical use.superconductor pioneersunsurprisingly, the nobel laureates made and continue to make huge contributions beyond their work in the 1980s. in addition to their academic work, martinis formerly headed the google quantum processor effort and now hashis own company, while devoret now assists with the google effort. clarke, now retired, also did much of his late-career work on quantum circuits. and they have had major impacts on my career and on so many others.i had the privilege to do a panel discussion with devoret on may 22, 2025. he made a memorable claim: picking an academic adviser can be even more of a big deal than picking a spouse, because \"you can't divorce your adviser.\"it's often joked that half the researchers in the field of quantum superconductors can trace an academic lineage to clarke. i can do it twice: my ph.d. adviser, irfan siddiqi, was advised by devoret, and clarke was my secondary adviser. and one of my proudest accomplishments as a grad student was not panicking when martinis snagged me after i gave a talk to grill me on the details.today they are honored for their work, and tomorrow i and the other researchers they trained will do our best to continue it.provided bythe
